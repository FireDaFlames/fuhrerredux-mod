### Description
USA_FUHRERREDUX_DESC:0 "Participating in the Great War on both the Mexican and European fronts, Theodore Roosevelt left the tables at Versailles angered at the stringent and demanding treaty. A nation now in political isolation, the country has descended into deep economic troubles. In the midst, several of the nation's holdings declared their own independence, including their Mexican client state. Now, with few friends and a couple powerful enemies, America stands divided as another great conflict looms on the horizon."

### Events
usa.0.t:0 "The State of Old Glory"
usa.0.d:0 "Since its inception, America’s relation with foreign intervention has been troubled and muddied to say the least. But in the past couple decades, the world has changed so drastically and the United States’ relation with the major powers of the world has been greatly strained. With the recent dissolution of the Bull Moose Party back into the Republican Party, the legacy of the late Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt has been called into question. After his main political opponent, Woodrow Wilson, was forced out of the Presidential race in 1912 following a heart attack, Roosevelt was barely able to win at the ballot boxes, ushering in a new and expansionist philosophy to the American zeitgeist. Not least on his radar was the brewing tides of war in Europe, which he was determined to keep the country out of, choosing to focus on the neighbors. \n\nThis was rendered impossible however- when Mexican nationalist Victor Carranza took power in Mexico, he became a formidable southern force. Brought to arms by the Americans’ recent occupation of Veracruz in the Tampico Affair, he mobilized his army- not for the offense, but to defend the country. As the Mexican Revolution wound down, a new war would start, and Germany would be the match that would light the tinderbox. The Zimmerman Declaration was decoded almost as quickly by American spies as Mexican ones, and what may have initially been swept aside was instead cast as a move to war. And neither side was going to back down. What began on 18 February 1917 in Mexico with the stroke of Roosevelt’s pen would not end until 11 November 1919 in Germany, and hundreds of thousands of American casualties would prove America’s place in the Entente’s victory. While at the Treaty of Marseilles, President Roosevelt would try to convince the powers of the world to agree to his “10 Points”- a document that would enforce a moderate peace, and hopefully a new faction of the democracies from America itself to France to even Japan. \n\nIts failure, and Roosevelt’s consequent infuriation at the insolence and disregard of Sir Lloyd George and Georges Clemenceau would bring him to declare, after leaving the conference “not to trust the Allies nor the Germans, for it seems that it is solely America’s duty to protect itself and its interests”. From then on, aside from trade as usual, the United States’ diplomacy with Europe went decidedly cold. The country became focused solely on its conquered neighbor to the south, installing a puppet regime and more than a few watchful eyes. After the death of Theodore only a couple short months later, the United States would be on the rise for near a decade; a combination of war profiteering and exploitation of the new Mexican puppet state. Presidents John J. Pershing (now a renowned war hero), Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover have passed in succession- the election of 1928 being particularly heated between Hoover and incumbent son Quentin Roosevelt. Now, 1936 has come, and the political scene has been largely shaped by the horrendous downturn of 1929- “Gilded Tuesday” that has near ruined America’s economy. \n\nIn the panic, the Mexican Republic was declared (which was decidedly an autocracy) and the Republic of the Philippines (which was more accurate to its name). This “Great Depression” is the name of the game in American politics, and with the next election sure to depose Herbert Hoover, four choices rally support to bring a new look to both domestic and foreign policy, and with the rise of the far right and left since the end of the Great War, where the United States will find itself has never seemed to be in a more precarious position."

usa.2.t:0 "Panic in Houston"
usa.2.d:0 "An explosion rocketed Houston, Texas this morning, causing several deaths and a currently untold number of injuries. Chief suspects of the incident include Mexican nationalists, though local police have not yet ruled out a domestic political group either. Included at the scene is what officers have been identifying as the flag of the Mexican State, though additional forensics research will have to be conducted. The target of the attack is believed to be a rail and trasportation hub in the city, but exactly which is not yet known, either.
