### History
PHI_FUHRERREICH_DESC:0 "After being colonized for 333 years by the Spanish, the Philippines won its independence with the help of the Americans. However, its indepence is short-lived as the US interests in the region made the Americans annex the archipelago shortly after the signing of the Treaty of Paris.\n\nFew decades later, the Americans have granted the Philippines autonomy under the Commonwealth and successfully gained its independence due to the effects of the Great Depression."

### Leader Descriptions
POLITICS_MANUEL_LUIS_QUEZON_DESC:0 "Manuel Quezon was born on Aug. 19, 1878, to Lucio Quezon and Maria Molina, both schoolteachers, in Baler, Tayabas (now Quezon) Province, in Luzon. Manuel enrolled at San Juan de Letran College, after which he was appointed lecturer at the University of Santo Tomás. There he studied law, but his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of the Spanish-American War.\n\nIn 1907 Quezon ran successfully as candidate for the Philippine Assembly on the Nacionalista party platform. In the Assembly he was elected floor leader, and Sergio Osmeña, his archrival, became Speaker of the House. Quezon served as resident commissioner in Washington, D. C. (1909-1916), where he became notorious as a romantic dancer, playboy diplomat, and shrewd lobbyist. He was instrumental in having a law revised so that Filipinos would form a majority in the Philippine Commission, the highest governing body in the Philippines. In February 1916 he cosponsored the Jones Act, which gave the Filipinos the power to legislate for themselves subject to veto by the American governor general. With this act, Quezon returned home a hero."
POLITICS_MANUEL_ROXAS_DESC:0 "Manuel A. Roxas was governor of the province of Capiz in 1919–21 and was then elected to the Philippine House of Representatives, subsequently serving as Speaker of the House and a member of the Council of State. In 1923 he and Manuel Quezon, the president of the Senate, resigned in protest from the Council of State when the U.S. governor-general (Leonard Wood) began vetoing bills passed by the Philippine legislature. In 1932 Roxas and Sergio Osmeña, the Nacionalista Party leader, led the Philippine Independence Mission to Washington, D.C., where they influenced the passage of the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act. Roxas was later opposed by Quezon, who held that the act compromised future Philippine independence; the Nacionalista Party was split between them on this issue. In 1934, however, Roxas was a member of the convention that drew up a constitution under the revised Philippine Independence and Commonwealth Act."
POLITICS_EMILIO_AGUINALDO_DESC:0 "Emilio Aguinaldo was born on March 22, 1869, in Kawit, Cavite, Philippines. Nicknamed Miong, Aguinaldo was the seventh of eight children. His parents were of Chinese and Tagalog descent. His father, Carlos, died when Aguinaldo was just nine years old. Widowed, his mother, Trinidad, sent him to attend public school in Manila.\n\nWhile serving as the head of barter in Manila, he joined the Pilar Lodge chapter of the Freemasonry in 1895. The Freemasonry was a government- and church-banned resistance group. It was through his role as municipal captain of this fraternity that Aguinaldo met Andres Bonifacio, a key figure in the fight to overthrow Spanish rule."
POLITICS_BASILIO_J_VALDEZ_DESC:0 "Basilio J. Valdes was professor of Surgery at the University of Santo Tomas (UST), Manila and Medical Director of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital. He was appointed chief-of-staff of the Philippine Constabulary in the 1930s.\n\nHonest, hardworking, and conscientious, Dr. Valdes and his achievements here and abroad have given prestige to his country and to himself. He went to France and joined the French Army as medical volunteer in 1916. He transferred to the U.S. Army a year after and continued to serve as surgeon until 1919. In February of the same year, he was appointed member of the Inter- Allied Commission to Germany; made chief of the Medical Service of the American Red Cross Commission to Germany, and later appointed Deputy Commissioner of the American Red Cross in Europe."
POLITICS_JOSE_P_LAUREL_DESC:0 "Jose P. Laurel, in full José Paciano Laurel, was born March 9, 1891, Tanauan, Luzon. Laurel was born and raised in a town south of Manila. His father served in the cabinet of Emilio Aguinaldo in the late 1890s. The younger Laurel received a law degree from the University of the Philippines in 1915 and an advanced jurisprudence degree in 1919 before earning a doctorate in civil law from Yale University in the United States in 1920. He entered politics and was elected to the Philippine Senate in 1925, serving there until he was appointed as Interim President of the new Philippine Republic."

Rizal, a Filipino nationalist have been executed by the Spaniards, the Filipino's nationalism have been awoken; revolutionaries have sprung all over Luzon and have successfully capture prominent cities and establish the first Philippine Republic.\n\nHowever, when independence is right on the Filipino's grasp, the Treaty of Paris have have made Spain cede the Philippine archipelago to the United States; and once again the Filipinos are fighting again for their independence. The United States have successfully annexed the archipelago, crushing the revolutionaries along the way. While the Tydings-McDuffie Act have granted the Philippines autonomy and an independence within 10 years, it came to the earlier than expected however as the Great Depression have made the United States grant independence to the Philippines to ease of expenditures.\n\nToday the Second Philippine Republic is an independent nation, forging its own path into the world, while there have been again threats to the Filipino nation, only time will tell if it can survive the next major global conflict."

PHI_submarine_1:0 "S Class"
PHI_submarine_1_desc:0 "The S boats, commonly known as Sugar Boats, were a series of 51 submarines design and built in the 1920s. Over the WW1 era O & R Boat series, the S Boats were larger allowing longer range and more torpedo reloads even though the class only had four forward-facing 21 inch tubes. Despite their age, with the last S Boat to be commissioned in 1924, the S Boats comprise a significant portion of the US Navy's standing Submarine force."
PHI_submarine_2:0 "Porpoise Class"
PHI_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Porpoise Class submarine was the US Navy's first modern submarine designed and built following a series of experimental "V Boats" built in the late 20s and early 30s. Despite initial issues with the all-electric propulsion, the class held promise and was being considered as future designs. The class was armed with 6 torpedo tubes and a 3" deck gun."
PHI_submarine_3:0 "Tambor Class"
PHI_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Tambor class was the culmination of years of US Naval experimentation of both Submarine design to fit the role of "Fleet Boat" and perform well in the waters of the Pacific Ocean. Armament was upgraded to 10 torpedo tubes with four firing aft, 3" deck gun with two AA guns for additional protection."
PHI_submarine_4:0 "Balao Class"
PHI_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Balao Class was a continuation of the design rooted in the Tambor class. Improvements came in the form of hull reinforcement and upgrading the deck gun to a 5"/24 caliber along with numerous subtle design improvements."
PHI_destroyer_1:0 "Clemson Class"
PHI_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Clemson Class destroyer continued with many design elements of its immediate predecessor, the Wickes Class. The Clemson had improved sea handling over the Wickes Class and was armed with 4"/50 caliber main guns, a 3"/23 caliber AA gun and 12 torpedo tubes. The class was aging and was nearly obsolete, but still comprised the bulk of the US Navy's Destroyer force."
PHI_destroyer_2:0 "Sims Class"
PHI_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Sims Class was the largest "1500 Tonner" design with a more streamlined torpedo arrangement and longer hull. Improvement in fire control granted better attack capabilities with its 5"/38 caliber guns and included 12 centerline torpedo tubes."
PHI_destroyer_3:0 "Fletcher Class"
PHI_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Fletcher Class represented a large step forward in terms of destroyer capability, thanks largely to its increase to 2500 tons. While keeping the 5"/38 dual purpose guns and centerline torpedo arrangement, the class added an additional single turret and received significant increases in AA weaponry as well as improved range and larger displacement."
PHI_destroyer_4:0 "Allen M Sumner Class"
PHI_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Sumner Class continued on the Fletcher Class with displacement only marginally increased. The ship was able to take on more armament gaining dual 5"/38 caliber guns and a much larger compliment of AA weaponry. The addition of a second rudder allowed for improve maneuvering during ASW operations."
PHI_light_cruiser_1:0 "Omaha Class"
PHI_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Omaha Class was initially designed to fill a key scouting role in the US Navy's WW1 fleet. A fast and capable class, the Omaha Class was armed with a formidable load out of 6"/53 caliber guns in an 8x1 and 2x2 turret configuration and six torpedo launchers. The Omaha Class was aging but comprised of the bulk of the US Navy's Light Cruiser force."
PHI_light_cruiser_2:0 "Brooklyn Class"
PHI_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Brooklyn Class was designed with the Washington Naval Treaty in mind and so was restricted to 6" guns. To maximize firepower, the Brooklyn's was armed with 15 of the new Mk16 6" guns in triple turrets. The overall design was very balanced and was considered as the basis of all future cruiser designs for the US Navy."
PHI_light_cruiser_3:0 "Cleveland Class"
PHI_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Cleveland Class was based on the Brooklyn Class, but without the Washington Naval Treaty restrictions. The Cleveland Class keeps the 12 6" main gun arrangement, but increased its secondary 5" armament greatly and added additional AA weaponry."
PHI_light_cruiser_4:0 "Fargo Class"
PHI_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Fargo Class improved on the successful Cleveland Class. It offered improved fields of AA fire thanks to a better designed pyramid-shaped superstructure."
PHI_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Pensacola Class"
PHI_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Pensacola Class were designed under the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty, and sought to maximize firepower under the 8" gun restriction. It was armed with a formidable armament of 10 x 8"/55 guns. The hull armor was thin and the design was top heavy but capable. It formed the bulk of the US Navy's Heavy Cruiser force."
PHI_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Wichita Class"
PHI_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Wichita Class ships improved armament over the Pensacola Class and its variants with a new turret design for its 8"55 caliber guns and improved the fields of fire for its secondary armament of 5"/38 guns. "
PHI_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Baltimore Class"
PHI_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Baltimore Class brought together the more successful elements of previous cruiser designs and was based largely off of the Brooklyn Class light cruiser married with configurations with armament and armor from the USS Wichita."
PHI_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Oregon City Class"
PHI_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Oregon City Class cruisers provided broad and marginal improvements over the Baltimore Class. Most notably was the change in the super structure which allowed better fields of AA fire. Similar improvements were also found from the Cleveland to the Oregon City class light cruisers."
PHI_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Lexington Class"
PHI_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Lexington Class was initially a reaction to Japan's Kongo class battlecruiser. Ordered by the Naval Act of 1916, the ships were intended to carry 16" guns in dual turrets and be capable of 33 knots. After construction began, the US entered into the Washington Naval Treaty and the USS Lexington and USS Saratoga was converted to Carriers."
PHI_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Alaska Class"
PHI_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Alaska Class was a response to the German pocket battleships now more so to Japan's "super cruisers." Designed to carry 12" guns and handle up to 10" shell fire, the class was capable of cruiser speeds but sacrificed under water protection."
PHI_battleship_1:0 "New York Class"
PHI_battleship_1_desc:0 "The New York Class battleships were the first US Battleships to be armed with the 14"/45 caliber main guns. Numerous 5"/51 guns provided secondary armament and over 10" of armor."
PHI_battleship_2:0 "North Carolina Class"
PHI_battleship_2_desc:0 "The North Carolina Class was a challenging design and was the first battleship class built by the US Navy in 20 years. The US Navy required this class to meet the standards of Washington Naval Treaty, limited to 36,000 tons yet be armed with the 16"/45 caliber guns and have improved armor while being capable of escorting the US Navy's fast aircraft carriers."
PHI_battleship_3:0 "Iowa Class"
PHI_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Iowa Class added all the innovations and capabilities of the earlier North Carolina, but substantially increases its displacement and tactical speed. The Iowa's was primarily responsible for escorting carriers groups and was designed with a second role of "cruiser killer" in mind."
PHI_battleship_4:0 "Illinois Class"
PHI_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Illinois Class continued with the design and role defined by the Iowa Class. It maintained speed and armament over armor. The Illinois Class increased the number of 16"/50 caliber guns from 9 to 12 while it also improved boilers and machinery in order to provide more efficient high cruise speeds. Like the Montana Class, initial designs included four 4 6" guns dual turrets, but this was reverted to the dual purpose 5" twin turret emplacements to maximize AA capabilities."
PHI_carrier_1:0 "Lexington Class"
PHI_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Lexington Class carrier was born from the converted hulls of two Lexington Class battlecruisers in order to conform to the limitations imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty. The class was the first operational carrier class in the US Navy and spent several years improving carrier operations."
PHI_carrier_2:0 "Ranger Class"
PHI_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ranger Class was the first US Navy class designed as a carrier from the keel up. As part of a US Navy smaller carrier concept the class was much smaller than the previous Lexington Class, yet still retained the same air group compliment thanks to improvements on interior designs."
PHI_carrier_3:0 "Essex Class"
PHI_carrier_3_desc:1 "With the lessons learned from the preceding Lexington, Ranger and Yorktown variant classes, the result was the Essex Class, a fast ship able to carry a large complement of planes into battle. Damage control designs would also be carried over from the Yorktown class and a deck edge elevator was included to improve plane handling."
PHI_carrier_4:0 "Midway Class"
PHI_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Midway Class was the ultimate in US Navy carrier capability. Implementing an armored deck and able to carry far more aircraft than previous classes, the Midway Class was being given a unique sub-class designation, CVB (Carrier Vessel Battle)."
PHI_SH_battleship_1:0 "Virginia Class"
PHI_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "In 1920 the construction of the large South Dakota Class battleships fielding 12 x 16"/50 guns started. The class would have ushered in a new era in heavy battleship design but was cancelled in 1922 to conform to the Washington Naval Treaty. With the Treaty no longer in effect and the threat of a secret Japanese battleship project we can modernize the design, increase displacement to over 55,000 tons and up gun the design with 18"/50 caliber guns to create a new class of heavy battleship."
PHI_SH_battleship_2:0 "Montana Class"
PHI_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Montana Class was bigger and more armored than the Illinois Class, sacrificing speed to accommodate the increase. Its main armament of 12 x 18"/50 caliber guns and with our latest fire control system the Montana's firepower will be unmatched. Initial designs included 6" guns, but this was changed to return to the dual purpose 5" twin turret emplacements."
