The governors have been discontented with the policies of the Federal Government and have outright seceeded from the union and have formed the New American Republic. While some of our citizens our respecting our authority; some do not, specially those who are in the lower classes and the minorities. They see as a mere puppet of the Corpoate Council; and not a legitimate government like those in Washington. Many have been proposing that we conduct some sort of a relations with the minorities and the working classes, however, there are also some, that don't want a compromise with them; as we have the troops that can pacify future threats if necessary."
