capture.1.t: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] Capture of Paris"
capture.1.d: "Reports from Paris confirm that the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] capital has been captured by advancing [FROM.GetAdjective] troops after furious fighting across its large avenues and the Seine. [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] forces put up stiff resistance, hoping to delay the [FROM.GetAdjective] forces for as long as possible, but were eventually beaten back.\n\nAs shocked Parisians looked on, the [FROM.GetAdjective] army paraded through the Champs-Elys√©es and towards the Eiffel Tower. This festive atmosphere eventually devolved into vicious urban combat, however, with [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] resistance in the dead of the night and [FROM.GetAdjective] force easily ploughing through inefficient barricades in the large Parisian avenues."
capture.1.d.ger: "As the sun rose on Paris, German artillery rained upon the city. Unorganized French militias quickly scrambled for their weapons, hardly even awake. German troops stormed the city, taking the industrial areas and hospitals and destroying French barracks with short and deadly firefights occurring around the city. Before the French backup could arrive from the near city of Versailles, most of the city was already under German occupation, and Le Jardin de Luxembourg has been temporarily turned into a POW camp. While there are still small fights happening on the outskirts of the city, it is effectively under German control."
capture.1.d.eng: "Paris, the capital and cultural center of France has today been captured by British soldiers. They had quickly moved in on the outskirts and with artillery fire combined with bomber planes, they were able to disorient the French and destroy much of the key buildings of the French army. Then they moved into the city. The French fought hard against the British, but they couldn;t stand a chance being somewhat undersupplied due to having lost most of their equipment and food to the bombing, they had to retreat. And though not all of the metropolis has been occupied yet, and some resistance fighters have already taken up arms, the Union Jack now flies over the Eiffel Tower."
capture.1.d.sov: "The day began normally for Parisians, actually, a bit too normal. They couldn't hear any artillery fire or the song of war like they usually do, it was a bit strange. But they shrugged it off as a ceasefire or something like that. Just as they got their days started, they heard screaming. A lot of it. They looked to see he Red Army storming the city as fighters and bombers took up the entire sky. Paris was in disarray, and the soldiers were unable to fight to their full potential as artillery, bombs, and gunfire rained upon them. The city was effectively captured. And the Soviets finally made it to Paris, beating out Tsar Alexander. The area under the Arc De Triomphe has been turned into a temporary hospital for sounded soldiers and a POW cam along the road that it leads out of. The Red banner flies before the capital of France."
capture.1.a: "No! We cannot let Paris fall once again!"
capture.1.b: "It seems the fall of [FROM.FROM.GetNameDef] is now all but assured."
