BRA_collectivist_party_long: "Partido Coletivista Brasileiro                                                  The Partido Coletivista Brasileiro is the main opposition party and the most vocal about their dislike of the current state of Brazil. This party is the greatest of a Socialist coalition that wishes for revolution, and the coalition is just a bigger version of it some people say. This collection of collectivists is very needy in their demands for Brazil, nothing will satisfy them until power is taken. And another factor that makes them a real thorn in the Liberal side is that they have hold of most of the workers, and they tend to strike. So until power is taken, the Partido Coletivista Brasileiro will remain a strong force in Brazilian politics, and with the Brazilian Lenin in charge, they will be a big part of the upcoming Brazilian future."

BRA_market_liberal_party_long: "Partido Democrático                                                  The Partido Democrático is the main party of Brazilian democratic politics, hosting a wide array of moderate liberalism and social liberalism. It is the main attractor of opposition as it among the Brazilian people has outlived its expiration date as it is still relying on the old ways that used to work rather than future policies. This party mainly concerns the political stability of Brazil these days and due to this, they have left much of the country paused in outdated industrialization plans, and the military remains largely underfunded. But maybe, the Liberals can one day bring stability back to the nation and restore Brazil back to its former state, or better yet, up to its full potential and beyond. The people still have trust that the party will do this, but as the country deteriorates these promises seem harder and harder to fufill."

The party has turned from a simple conservative party into a coalition of sorts between these politicians and parties in the aftermath of the Great War, and the parties that merged to form are the Integralists, the Monarchists, the original Liga Eleitoral Catolica, who has been dominated by politicans like Arthur Bernardes, Plínio Salgado, Getúlio Vargas, and many others. While they get along together fine now, the coalition is delicate. But if it means keeping communism out of Brazil or even better, taking the country, the party will stay together."

#Brazil Events
bra.1.t: "Brazil in 1936"
bra.1.d: "Since the Great War, Brazil has been able to show itself as succesful on the world stage. With a constantly growing economy, a great population, full of resources and filled with potential, everything seems to be going good for Brazil.\n\nThat's what the international observers see. But inside Brazil the feeling is very different. The ruling government, widely regarded as oligarchic and disinterested in the people, has continued for decades with the tradition of Cafe-com-leite politics, where the "democratic" government has been controlled by the influential states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais, and their oligarchic coronel patrons, that have not cared for the deep social and economical disparities in our society.\n\nA marxist insurrection in 1931 didn't help either, and the violence of it has spread a sense of anti-red sentiment amongst some of the population, who in disapproval of the decadent republic and in hate of marxism has turned to alternative populist groups spreading a message against the government.\n\nLuckily for the government, the gambit of intervening in the Chaco War to the south, preventing the growth of Argentina's influence in our vicinities has given some legitimacy to the government, that has succesfully shown Brazil as strong. Nonetheless, their support is a fraction of our nation, and it seems the seams of our republic are showing, as political polarization mantains."
bra.1.a: "We have to get through this""
bra.2.t: "Minor strikes all over"
bra.2.d: "Different workers' aggrupations have declared being on strike, looking for further rights and laws to their benefit. This show of chaos has been supported directly by the PCB, that has shown an agenda of mobilizing the workers of Brazil in their support. A worrying trend."
bra.2.a: "We don't need this."
bra.3.t: "LEC reunites people in rally"
bra.3.d: "Founded a couple of years ago by catholic activist Plinio Correa, the Catholic Electoral League has been in the background for most of it. Pushing for the establishment of more religious policies and traditionalism in Brazilian Society, it surged in reaction to the rather liberal reforms the government implemented after the Insurrection of 31', and has accused the government of being "decadent" and "unmoral".\n\nHowever, it's strong anti-marxist attitude and being contrarian to the disliked government has found Correa's movement a growing support base recently. Today in a rally for his cause thousands of people showed up in support for the LEC. We have to keep an eye out on this."
bra.3.a: "I'm sure it's nothing."
bra.3.b: "Try to censure this event."
bra.4.t: "Valquismo in the south"
bra.4.d: "A very recent yet quickly growing group has appeared in Brazil. Headed by Gustavo Dodt Barroso, they have imported the german ideology of Valkism to our country. With a nationalist, anti-socialist rethoric, populist ideas catering to the common people, and progressive proposals catering to the young, they have found great support in our southern regions, where those with german ancestry have shown great liking to it. A rally is planned for tomorrow, in Porto Alegre, and it seems it will be their largest to date."
bra.4.a: "Stop the rally."
bra.4.b: "What's the worst that could happen?"
bra.5.t: "Workers' Confederation supports Collectivists"
bra.5.d: "In a not surprising at all move, the COB has announced their explicit support for the collectivist movements. With the support of the largest syndicates in Brazil, this may help quite a bit the Collectivist Party.\n\nNothing good for the ruling government can come out of this, for sure."
bra.5.a: "There is nothing we can do."
bra.5.b: "Penalize the COB for this political movement."
bra.6.t: "Tensions in the government"
bra.6.d: "While our internal enemies are plenty, there is still room for disunity, as members of the PR have shown discontent at how our government is handling the internal situation, blaming us on the current set of events. This kind of internal trasgression is not a good idea."
bra.6.a: "It's a very bad idea."
bra.7.t: "The divisions inside the army"
bra.7.d: "Serving proudly for long and helping us dissuade dissidents, the Brazilian Army has been very useful for our internal stability. However, rumours have started of potential dissidents inside the army itself, it seems some of our Generals may not like how we are handling the situation, and we need to watch our back. It has also been heard that while some support the legitimate government, they don't trust us to get out of this either. We need our army united to get through this."
bra.7.a: "We really do."
bra.8.t: "Presidential Speech"
bra.8.d: "In a safely guarded event, considered by many dangerous, the President Salles decided that it would be a good idea to make a speech calling for unity and support inside Brazil. While in a surprisingly nice evening, no dissidents tried to ruin the event, it attracted a smaller crowd than expected."
bra.8.a: "We'll get through this."
bra.10.t: "The London Market Crash on Brazil"
bra.10.d: "Awful news have arrived for our economy, as the effects of the London Stock Market Crash seem to have stopped our economic growth and hit us when we didn't need it to."
bra.10.a: "Let's hope it doesn't worsen things..."
bra.11.t: "Mass strikes begin"
bra.11.d: "As exports are cancelled and the industry collapses, mass strikes have began. The workers, radicalized, have taken the blame on the government and the system we have built for Brazil.\n\nIt seems memories of the insurrection are coming back to mind, let's hope another revolution attempt doesn't occur."
bra.11.a: "This is bad."
bra.12.t: "Right-Wing movements unite against government and marxism."
bra.12.d: "In a surprising move, in Santa Catarina, The LEC and the UVB have reunited, as well as other movements of similar veins. Claiming they must stand strong against the menace of Collectivism, in sight of the current strikes, and denouncing the republican government for our situation, an unlikely alliance has been born.\n\nTogether, they declared that they will do whatever it takes to bring to Brazil the order it needs, that the republic hasn't been able to give, and that the marxists want to take away completely."
bra.12.a: "This is worrying."
bra.20.t: "Western States reintegrate into our Country"
bra.20.d: "After the Civil War, our nation become extremely divided, even after the fighting ended. Now, the tensions are getting colder and we can finally look upon each others as brothers again."
bra.20.a: "We welcome them."
bra.21.t: "Southern States reintegrate into our Country"
bra.21.d: "After the Civil War, our nation become extremely divided, even after the fighting ended. Now, the tensions are getting colder and we can finally look upon each others as brothers again."
bra.21.a: "We welcome them."
bra.22.t: "Southern States reintegrate into our Country"
bra.22.d: "After the Civil War, our nation become extremely divided, even after the fighting ended. Now, the tensions are getting colder and we can finally look upon each others as brothers again."
bra.22.a: "We welcome them."
bra.23.t: "Eastern States reintegrate into our Country"
bra.23.d: "After the Civil War, our nation become extremely divided, even after the fighting ended. Now, the tensions are getting colder and we can finally look upon each others as brothers again."
bra.23.a: "We welcome them."
bra.24.t: "Eastern States reintegrate into our Country"
bra.24.d: "After the Civil War, our nation become extremely divided, even after the fighting ended. Now, the tensions are getting colder and we can finally look upon each others as brothers again."
bra.24.a: "We welcome them."
bra.25.t: "Western States reintegrate into our Country"
bra.25.d: "After the Civil War, our nation become extremely divided, even after the fighting ended. Now, the tensions are getting colder and we can finally look upon each others as brothers again."
bra.25.a: "We welcome them."
bra.26.t: "An Unexpected Betrayal?"
bra.26.d: "As the civil war has taken its toll on us, it has been apparent to everyone that the capabilities of our president to mantain control has been questioned. Not only by the obvious traitors, but also my our own forces. The army in particular has been shady in its loyalties.\n\nThis finally catapulted into action when this afternoon general Euclides Figueiredo showed up with an ultimatum for the president to stand down, as the military, under his lead, would take direct control of the republic's state apparatus and lead Brazil during this civil war. Not everyone seemed to support him, however."
bra.26.a: "The Army takes over, under Figueiredo's leadership."

bra.50.t: "The States' Rivalry"
bra.50.d: "Decades under political hegemony under Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais has made us forget the true nature of our republic, an union of states. Or at least, so have felt the "other" states, and have so expressed their representatives in a message to our president.\n\nWhile no one can deny that this is the case, this has left president Salles in a rather awkward position. By giving the favour to the states, he'd help sustain the stability of our nation, something which is sorely needed. But it would make Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais upset, and their hold into our political system is such that doing so would make them disrupt our government. This is not a very easy decision."
bra.50.a: "We need to keep true to the union."
bra.50.b: "The republic is working as intended."
bra.51.t: "Brazil's Power"
bra.51.d: "While our government's strong show of influence during the Chaco War has lead many to believe Brazil is strong and able, this was only a show, while our nation has been divided and unstable. As strikes and political movements radicalize inside our borders, it seems the world is slowly noticing our real status."
bra.51.a: "We could be so much more."
bra.52.t: "The Issue of Coronelism"
bra.52.d: "Coronelism, the great social and political influence carried by the landed coronels, has became the great issue that divides our society. Or at least, that's popularly acclaimed. The coronels themselves, as well as their allies in different government posts, would like to claim no issue exists, and our union stands strong as ever.\n\nNo matter what we believe, however, an official policy has to be taken. Should Coronelism just be considered the natural, beneficial power structure that makes Brazilian society what it is, or should we consider it as something to reform from, into a more representative model?"
bra.52.a: "Coronelism is not an issue."
bra.52.b: "Coronelism has to change."
bra.53.t: "Negotiations with urban workers"
bra.53.d: "Growing urban discontent, specially amongst the urban workers and the also growing middle class, has reached peak levels. Thus, negotiating with them, specially with strikes on the rise, might be a good idea.\n\nAssuming, of course, we manage to find a deal benefitial for both parties."
bra.53.a: "Give them what they want, for now."
bra.53.b: "It may not be beneficial for us."
bra.54.t: "The Worker Dilemma"
bra.54.d: "Social unequalities have been present in Brazil since imperial days. However, for too long the workers were unorganized and tightly in control by the upper classes. Now it's different. With the organization of workers in unions and syndicates, the growth of socialist and populist ideologies, and all along a rather polarized political scene, we can't grow Brazil pretending they don't exist anymore. Or so has been claimed by reformers. The government, however, remains divided towards this issue, whether should it or not be considered a matter of upmost urgency for our nation or not."
bra.54.a: "We'll do what we can for the workers."
bra.54.b: "It's not our priority."
bra.55.t: "Reforming the Union"
bra.55.d: "Born in a dream of democracy and equality between the states, for far too long the landed gentry, the oligarchic coronels have disrupted this dream. The ideal of reforming the republic into this dream is now greater than ever, as our country is divided and torn by the war, so it has been made clear whose fault is it.\n\nThis posture has been obviously rejected by the oligarchs, that blame the current chaos at the traitors that didn't follow their rule willingly. Now, with our government reformism at its peak amongst our populace and our government, it seems like the Coronels will be a stone in our path, that will have to be dealt with. Well, another stone, considering the mess we are stuck at."
bra.55.a: "We'll recreate this union."
bra.56.t: "Our Pride Betrayed"
bra.56.d: "The coronels, the noble and landed gentry that has lead our nation towards being the envy of many, has been betrayed. The weak reformists that sought to make the republic what it's not, and the envious states that didn't realize the best were ruling Brazil in a dign manner, divided us, causing the current chaos to drown us.\n\nSo has been proclaimed by the government, that with full support of the Coronels, has denounced the forces of change that have struck the republic. This however, has been massively unpopular with the common people, that don't empathise whatsoever with such claims."
bra.56.a: "We need to bring back th old order."
bra.57.t: "Division amongst the government"
bra.57.d: "As the civil war surrounds us, it seems this conflict has caused political tensions inside the structure of our legitimate government, as expected. While the war efforts are stable, a rift has been created between those that want to reform the republic, blaming the old order in our current chaos, believing that only with reform Brazil can be brough together. On the other hand, some less popular yet very much influential groups have brough the idea that it is those dreams of reform which weakened us in first place and put is our current situation.\n\nThe only thing that's clear is that no one is happy with this situation."
bra.57.a: "We must reform!"
bra.57.b: "We must go back!"
bra.57.c: "The Stalemate Continues."
bra.58.t: "An Unexpected Betrayal?"
bra.58.d: "As the civil war has taken its toll on us, and our government remains unable to unite even under the current crisis, it has been apparent to everyone that the capabilities of our president to mantain control has been questioned. Not only by the obvious traitors, but also my our own forces. The army in particular has had loyalties of its own.\n\nThis finally catapulted into action when this afternoon general Euclides Figueiredo showed up with an ultimatum for the president to stand down, as the military, under his lead, would take direct control of the republic's state apparatus and lead Brazil during this civil war. Not everyone seemed to support him, however."
bra.58.a: "Order is needed."
bra.27.t: "Post Civil-War Elections"
bra.27.d: "With the civil war having ended, we must bring up snap elections to help choose a capable leader to rebuild our dying nation. Whoever will be elected will be the people's choice. Or the leader's."
bra.27.a: "Liberals"
bra.27.b: "Conservatives"
bra.27.c: "Socialists"
bra.27.d: "The leader remains in power"
bra.27.e: "The Shogun finds his way into the government halls!"
bra.28.t: "Military in the Government?"
bra.28.d: "To help stabilize our shattered nation after the military valliantly led the country through such a hard time, we have to discuss the posision of military in government and politics."
bra.28.a: "They don't belong."
bra.28.b: "They have proven themselves."
bra.29.t: "Minority Rights?"
bra.29.d: "The minorities and natives of Brazil have been not neglected but surley do not have rights to their claimed land or just in general, and having them on our side for another potential unrest or crisis would be a good as the natives know the land and the minorities can be good for working in the factories and industrial areas as potential manpower."
bra.29.a: "They could help us in the longrun."
bra.29.b: "It not their time."

bcw.1.t: "Collectivists rise up in revolt"
bcw.1.d: "As the general strike intensifies, the covers have came off. Today, Luis Prestes, head of the Collectivist Party, has declared revolution, as the workers of Brazil will fight once again, and try to accomplish what they couldn't years ago, the socialist Union of Brazil has risen up.

bcw.3.b: "We'll stand for the Nation."
bcw.4.t: "The Rebirth of Brazil"
bcw.4.d: "As was expected, the death of the Brazilian Republic was imminent. Now, we have risen, to save our nation from the chaos and decandency it has fallen upon. The Republic has failed us, and the Marxists have divided us. Only together, those who stand for the nation, can rebuild Brazil, in the true, perfect vision of how it should be.\n\nSo was proclaimed as heading the coalition, Plinio Correa declared we beginning of a new age for Brazil, where we will be the ones to decide its fate."
bcw.4.a: "Onwards, for Brazil!"
bcw.25.t: "The End of the Civil War"
bcw.25.d: "Peace is seemingly back in our nation, as both the collie revolutionaries in the west and the traitors in the south collapsed to our forces.

bcw.25.a: "Ordem e progresso!"
bcw.26.t: "The End of the Civil War"
bcw.26.d: "Peace is seemingly back in our nation, as our revolution has succeeded after the collapse of the reactionaries, both the oligarchs in the capital and the extremists in the south.

While fight continues in pockets of traitors causing chaos around our nation, they will soon be taken care of.\n\nWe have came out of the most chaotic period for our nation, and risen up for Brazil's fate, and now it is time to begin the reconstruction, to bring order and to reshape the path this nation is taking, leading us towards the glory we deserve, where no one will challenge our greatness."

#some descriptions
POLITICS_CARLOS_FREILE_LARREA_DESC: "Ascending as president after the death of his predecessor, Neftalí Bonifaz, Carlos Freile Larrea has found himself in a difficult position, having to balance the desires of his own Party and interests, the UPN, with those of his main source of support, the National Workers' Compact, that has slowly been turning Ecuador into an ultra-conservative pseudo-syndicalist state, but not without facing the opposition of traditional power groups."
POLITICS_JuanmaFruc_DESC: "Bringing the Colorados to power, Presidente Fructos has to delicately know how to balance the loyalties of his party, the army, and the upset working classes."
POLITICS_BASMUNN_DESC: "After president Terra's ambitions put in question the strength of democracy in Uruguay, Basilio Muñoz quickly rose to challenge his rule, and became president after Terra's deposing. Now, he has to lead Uruguay as it seeks to rebuild its republican structure once again."
POLITICS_SANTOS_DOMINICI_DESC: "Leading the restitution of Venezuela's Democracy after Delgado Chalbaud-Cardona's Expedition brought the Catfish down, president Dominici has built an outstanding legacy. The future is uncertain, however, and Venezuela might find itself in disarray after his mandate ends."
BRA_CHARACTER_ARMANDO_SALLES: "Armando Salles"
BRA_ARMANDO_SALLES_DESC: "Armando de Salles Oliveira was born on December 24th, 1887 in Sao Paulo, son of an enginner and former state senator of the state of Sao Paulo. He studied at Colegio Progresso Brasileiro, and after studied at the state gymnasium. In his early carreer he was exposed to much of Brazilian politics, and so soon became a politician in his fathers footsteps. Oliveira became a partner of the O Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper as he funneled plenty of anti government newspapers across the country. The government caught wind of this, and confiscated the newspaper and arrested some of the men in charge of it, but Oliveira was spared. Seeing the governments authoritarian sort of way to deal with opposition, in after becoming senator of Sao Paulo, he ran for president in 1930, beating our every other opposition party with his own hands.

Though his first reforms were pretty beneficiary at first, and attracted investment from other countries to boost the economy, he had to pause these reforms as the Collectivists and Catholics rose as dominant opposition parties against him. He was a very good mediator during the Chaco War, helping keep it out of his borders and housing refugees while still being completely neutral. In 1934, he was barely re-elected as he and the Pardito Liberdator formed a coaltion to beat out the opposition.

While he became the main leader and eventually ended the coalition soon after, Oliveiras position is under threat, but despite that he is still popular amongst the elite and the people. However, as strife once again fills the republic, it may all go down the drain."
