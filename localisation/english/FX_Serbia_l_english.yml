### EVENTS ###

serbia.1.t: "Crowned Eagle of Serbia"
serbia.1.d: "For all intent and purpose, the modern world is entirely shaped by the decisions of a Serb. That is at least how one can choose to look upon the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914, and the fallout from that decision. While Serbia was in the crossfire of the Central Powers during the Great War, the conflict would eventually turn in favor of Serbia and their Entente allies.\n\nThe end of the Great War would bring an opportunity for the Serbian nation to lead the charge for a union between the Southern Slavic peoples. While Vojvodina and Montenegro was willing to unite with Serbia, this dream would find opposition from our very own brothers the Croats and the Slovenes. Serbia favored a unitary Yugslavia under their king, while the Croats and Slovenes favored federalism. The negotiations would fall apart, almost leading to conflict between the Serbs and their neighbors over the borderlands. With many Serbs living in former Austrian territories, Serbia was uninterested in leaving their people in the hands of the Croats.\n\nThe Entente powers would act as mediators between Serbia and the Croats and Slovenes, leading to the division of the land between Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia. The constant struggle over the form of government a Yugoslav nation should have, might also have given room to these Entente powers to increase their influence over the region.\n\nThe post-war era would see a new king, Alexander I, accend the throne of Serbia. Reigning for 15 years, this era have seen stability and peace return to the region, even if the air of conflict is short to brew. Serbia is still holding on to the dream of a united Yugoslavia, one ruled from Beograd. The recent years, however, have seen figures rise to challenge the unitary vision. Instead supporting compromise with federalists. This has become a view that have grown influence in the Democratic Party, rising to challenge the hegemonic position of the People's Radical Party. There is also a rising tension from the pro-Bulgarian Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, seeking to separate and unite with the Bulgarian regime.\n\nIt is too early to tell what the future will bring to Serbia. With the potential for new conflicts to arise, many are urging more than ever to finalize the unification of the Southern Slavs, despite what domestic and foreign interests may oppose to it."
serbia.1.a: "Bože pravde!"

serbia.2.t: "Hungary invites us to their faction"
serbia.2.d: "In a surprising turn of events, we have recieved a letter from Budapest adressed to the King himself. It appears that the Hungarians are formally inviting us to a faction with them. They say that this alliance will allow for border exchanges and treaties to take place between us and that both nations will benifit greatly. We must choose wisely."
serbia.2.a: "We must put old rivalries aside."
serbia.2.b: "Serbia must forge her own path in history."

serbia.3.t: "Hungary demands Bosnia!"
serbia.3.d: "The Hungarians, in their infinite persuit of power, have sent us a list of demands, including all of our Bosnian held territories! While we may be able to fend the Hungarians off by ourselves, it would surely ruin the nation and perhaps expose one of our weak points."
serbia.3.a: "Bosnia is a small concession for peace..."
serbia.3.b: "We will never back down to the Magyar!"

serbia.4.t: "Bosnia for peace?"
serbia.4.d: "The Hungarians are far stronger than we had anticipated, and they may soon reach our capital. We can offer them Bosnia and Herzogovina in return for peace, but this will be seen as a shameful act in the eyes of both our government and our people. We can keep fighting, but if we lose then the Magyars will have free reign over our nation."
serbia.4.a: "We will give up Bosnia, for the good of the nation."
serbia.4.b: "The Magyars are weak, we need only a few months more..."

serbia.5.t: "The Croatian Revolt spreads to Bosnia!"
serbia.5.d: "The Croatians have only just recently risen up in Hungary, hoping to earn their independance through blood and iron. Now we are recieving reports that Bosnia and Herzogovina have both declared their complete allegance to the Croatian State, and has officially secceded from our nation. We must reign in the Bosnian provinces if we are to remain a relavant regional power!"
serbia.5.a: "We will show the Croatians what it means to revolt against us."

serbia.6.t: "Croatia wins their independance."
serbia.6.d: "The fighting has dragged on for many long months now, and we are unable to make a significant dent in our enemies defenses. A delegation has been sent by both of our allies, asking for peace, and we must now follow suit. We cannot defeat the Croatians together, let alone by ourselves. Croatia will have their state, until the next major war allows us to reclaim our rightful territories."
serbia.6.a: "This is a day which will live in infamy..."

serbia.7.t: "Hungary demands West Banat!"
serbia.7.d: "The Hungarian government today has demanded that we return the region of West Banat to them, or face certain consiquences. The region is extremely defensible and valuable from a strategic standpoint. Giving up the land would be a foolish move that would upset the people greatly, but we also must consider that Hungary mau attempt to take it by force if we decline."
serbia.7.a: "West Banat is of little importance, they can have it."
serbia.7.d: "They'll have to pry it from our cold, dead hands."

Foreign companies in Serbia have over night fired hundreds of employees, while the export of Serbian goods to France, Britain and Italy have significantly stagnated. The lack of export have seen the domestic market floded with Serbian products not being sold, in the end destabilizing the Serbian dinar.\n\nOn the bright side, the economy is more stable than in our neighbors, Croatia and Greece. Many believe that the crisis will be more temporary than in other nations."

Reports have come in that the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization have increased their operations after the attempt. With an increase in terror, local officials ask for more assistance from Beograd to contain these rebels. Unrest have not only come from IMRO, as pro-Albanian resistance once believed to be snuff out, have arisen anew. This Albanian resistance have begun to use the Šar Mountains as base to strike out against Serbian forces.\n\nWith the political situation still unstable in Beograd, little resources have been able to be given these unrests."

In the south, the Albanian minority have become more unrestful, while Macedons in the rural regions of Vardar Macedonia have began shifting towards the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization. While some of our officials fears that the economic crisis will manage to sow rebellion among these peoples, many do think that it is still unlikely."
