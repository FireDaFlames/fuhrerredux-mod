### Events
arabia.0.t:0 "The Arabian Peninsula, 1936"
arabia.0.d:0 "As the Great War rages on, the current Emir and Sharif of Mecca, Hussein bin Ali, have led a great revolt against the Ottoman oppresors, to free the holy lands from Constatinople and proclaim an independent Arabian state. After the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in the Great War, the Entente powers, mainly France and Britain have carved out the Ottoman Empire, Lebanon and some areas falling to the French sphere of influence are created to a French Protectorate of Phoenicia, the British, unsurprisingly, created the Protectorate of the Mashriq Kingdom, with a Hashemite on the throne, Faisal I of Iraq; and in the case of the Arabian peninsula, the British kept their promise and recognized and supported a new independent Arabian state under Hussein bin Ali, the King of Hejaz, and the British went over and provided aid to modernize the newly independent kingdom, albeit at the cost of British influence in the politics of Arabia.\n\nAs pilgrims from Nejd were denied access from entering the holy places in Hejaz, the Emirate of Nejd began military campaigns against Hejaz and advancing towards Taif. Sharif Hussein briefly requested British assistance to the matter, with the British a limited volunteer force, military advisors and material support. Armed with British support and officers, men of the Royal Hejazi Armed Forces turned the tide and pushed through the territories of Nejd, capturing Riyadh, a month later. As the Hejazi army captured Riyadh, the Emirate of Nejd capitulated and its territories were integrated into the newly proclaimed Hashemite Kingdom of Arabia."
arabia.0.a:0 "May Allah guide us on our path!"
arabia.1.t:0 "Village Raided by the Ikhwan!"
arabia.1.d:0 "One of our patrols in the Nejd region has stumbled across what remains of a smouldering village. The few panicked survivors first tried to hide from our unit but after one of our native soldiers took off his cap and set aside his rifle, one of the survivors managed to get over his fear and tell a horrible story about the camel riders of the east who swarmed in to take prisoners off as slaves. Anyone who resisted did not see much fruit for their labours. Another soldier calls out that he can make out a faint trail moving east but a sandstorm appears to be moving up from the south..."
arabia.1.a:0 "After them!"
arabia.1.b:0 "We'll need make it"
arabia.2.t:0 "Army Attack on Nejd"
arabia.2.d:0 "In a brazen move, aimed at stopping the Ikhwan raids amongst our subjects, we have sent a detachment of the Hejazi army deep into the desert to raid their oases. Supported with modern rifles and air support, their Ikhwan stood no chance at stopping us but they were able to harass the Hejazi columns before retreating back into the deserts."
arabia.2.a:0 "And don't come back!"
arabia.3.t:0 "Arrival of British Oil Prospectors"
arabia.3.d:0 "At 3pm in this warm afternoon a cruiser ship carrying some British civillians and some cargo have arrived in the port city of Jeddah. Among the civillians onboard are some British oil prospectors hoping to find some more oil deposits in the most remote and unexplored areas of the Kingdom. Fired with enthusiasm, after unboarding the ship, they quickly organized their equipment and belongings and proceeded to board a train en-route to the Nejd region. Whether this adventure will bear fruit, only time will tell."
arabia.3.a:0 "I hope they find something!"
arabia.4.t:0 "Prospectors Reported Missing"
arabia.4.d:0 "The foreign office have received a telegram from the [ENG.GetAdjective] consulte that the prospectors that arrived in our kingdom have not yet reported to either to their families, company and consulate. Equipped with the state of the art devices, the consulate of [ENG.GetNameDef] are worried that something have happened to the prospectors. The government have already proceeded to conduct a mission to search the whole Arabian peninsula but no results have come up yet."
arabia.4.a:0 "Oh no..."
arabia.5.t:0 "A Tragedy in Al-Hasa"
arabia.5.d:0 "As our garrison units are roaming around the region of Al-Hasa, they spotted something peculiar. Upon coming near on some kind of a small oasis, they confirmed that they have found a couple of body, one still quite alive, on his last breath. As our units approached the remaining alive, he said his last words, namely, \"Ikhwan\" before ultimately dying. Our units carried the bodies and returned here in the capital. The [ENG.GetAdjective] consulate were informed of this tragedy and the ambassador are preparing to inform London."
arabia.5.a:0 "This could get ugly."
arabia.6.t:0 "British Prospectors Found Dead in Al-Hasa!"
arabia.6.d:0 "The foreign office have received a telegram from our consulate in Mecca that the prospectors exploring the vast deserts of the Arabian peninsula have been found dead by Hashemite troops patrolling the region. It seems that the rebelling and hostile Ikhwan tribes still hiding in the remote areas of the kingdom are the ones responsible. The intelligence services, together with the Royal Air Force have pinpointed one our their hiding locations and are ready to strike back; but some in the government only demands an apology from the Hashemite Government, and try helping them defeat the Ikhwans."
arabia.6.a:0 "Demand an apology from [ARB.GetAdjective] Government!"
arabia.6.b:0 "Conduct a RAF strike in the region!"
arabia.7.t:0 "[ENG.GetName] Conducts an Air Strike"
arabia.7.d:0 "The [ENG.GetAdjective] Royal Air Force with airbases in the Trucial States, have launched an air operation to avenge the killing of the [ENG.GetAdjective] civillians in Al-Hasa by the Ikhwan tribesmen. Reports from the [ENG.GetAdjective] consulate states that as many as 100 were confirmed to be dead from the conducted air operation."
arabia.7.a:0 "Welp, the [ENG.GetAdjective] did our job."
arabia.8.t:0 "Oil Deposits Found on Al-Hasa"
arabia.8.d:0 "The [ENG.GetAdjective] prospectors exploring the vast deserts of the Arabian peninsula have found their gold; liquid gold that is. They have successfully found an oil deposit near the region of Al-Hasa. They have returned to the capital, Mecca to celebrate their success in the [ENG.GetAdjective] consulate."
arabia.8.a:0 "Let the oil flow..."
arabia.9.t:0 "[ENG.GetAdjective] Government Demands an Apology"
arabia.9.d:0 "The [ENG.GetAdjective] Government, following the paths of diplomacy have demanded that we issue an apology on the killing on the [ENG.GetAdjective] prospectors killed by the Ikhwan tribesmen. They stated that it was our partial fault in the tragedy as we have still failed in repressing Ikhwan raids on the former territories of the Emirate of Nejd."
arabia.9.a:0 "Fine, we'll do it."
arabia.10.t:0 "[ARB.GetAdjective] Government Issues an Apology"
arabia.10.d:0 "The [ARB.GetAdjective] Foreign Ministry have issued a formal apology on behalf of the killings of the [ENG.GetAdjective] prospectors by the hostile Ikhwan tribes in the former territories of Nejd. They state that in order to preserve the friendship of the two countries, the kingdom will accept our responsibilities and pledged to suppress the remaining hostile Ikhwan raiders terrorizing the eastern remote parts of the Kingdom."
arabia.10.a:0 "Great."
arabia.11.t:0 "Black Wednesday Hits the Desert"
arabia.11.d:0 "As our kingdom's economy is tied with the British economy and to an extent the \"Commonwealth\" the stock market crash have proved to be catastrophic for our own home market. The effects are now being felt into by the common Arab and oil trade has now come to an all time low."
arabia.11.a:0 "May Allah help us..."
