### Events
arabia.0.t:0 "The Arabian Peninsula, 1936"
arabia.0.d:0 "As the Great War rages on, the current Emir and Sharif of Mecca, Hussein bin Ali, have led a great revolt against the Ottoman oppresors, to free the holy lands from Constatinople and proclaim an independent Arabian state. After the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in the Great War, the Entente powers, mainly France and Britain have carved out the Ottoman Empire, Lebanon and some areas falling to the French sphere of influence are created to a French Protectorate of Phoenicia, the British, unsurprisingly, created the Protectorate of the Mashriq Kingdom, with a Hashemite on the throne, Faisal I of Iraq; and in the case of the Arabian peninsula, the British kept their promise and recognized and supported a new independent Arabian state under Hussein bin Ali, the King of Hejaz, and the British went over and provided aid to modernize the newly independent kingdom, albeit at the cost of British influence in the politics of Arabia.\n\nAs pilgrims from Nejd were denied access from entering the holy places in Hejaz, the Emirate of Nejd began military campaigns against Hejaz and advancing towards Taif. Sharif Hussein briefly requested British assistance to the matter, with the British a limited volunteer force, military advisors and material support. Armed with British support and officers, men of the Royal Hejazi Armed Forces turned the tide and pushed through the territories of Nejd, capturing Riyadh, a month later. As the Hejazi army captured Riyadh, the Emirate of Nejd capitulated and its territories were integrated into the newly proclaimed Hashemite Kingdom of Arabia."
