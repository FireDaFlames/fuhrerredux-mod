UKR_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "Following the collapse of the Russian Empire, the Ukrainian people sought to establish their own state along the Dnieper river. The German Empire briefly established a client state with the hopes of using Ukraine's vast fields to feed the Imperial Army, but was forced to evacuate the region following the German revolution in 1918. The Ukrainian People's Republic was re-established, and thrown into the chaos of the Russian Civil War. Coming out victorious against the bolsheviks, the Ukrainians seeked to distance themselves from Russia and create a unique Ukrainian identity wedged between Soviet Russia and a resurgent Germany. With tensions once more rising in Europe, Ukraine must place her bets and pick a side, or be lost to the annals of time."

UKR_logistics_improvements: "Logistics Improvements"
UKR_logistics_improvements_desc: "Although our largely flat terrain is usually seen as a disadvantage, there is one key upside to it. That is, the ease of logistical supply. Taking steps to ensure we can keep continuously supplying our troops is our current chief directive."

UKR_anti_air_and_anti_tank_desc: "Artillery has become more and more useful in warfare, so much so that many frontline battalions nowadays are exclusively based on punishing artillery fire.

UKR_science_of_war_desc: "As we march into the future, it becomes plainly obvious that new wars will rather be won using superior technology than any long-form trench warfare or “flood-wave” tactics.

We must invest in naval bombers to gain an edge on big, bulky navies."
UKR_deploy_the_new_fighter_prototypes: "Deploy the New Fighter Prototypes"
UKR_deploy_the_new_fighter_prototypes_desc: "In recent years we've taken to developing our own Fighter designs, with some joint effort from our other allies. Our efforts have paid off, it seems.

UKR_a_domestic_bomber_model: "A Domestic Bomber Model"
UKR_a_domestic_bomber_model_desc: "Bombers have been shown to be very effective in disabling various elements of the war machine of any given warring nation. Whenever the next major European war comes, and it will, we must be ready. Depending on the designs utilised by our suppliers (primarily Germany) is all well and good, but it isn't completely viable. As such, we must begin working on own designs."
UKR_strategic_bomber_prototype: "Strategic Bomber Prototype"
UKR_strategic_bomber_prototype_desc: "Bombing enemy production facilities and supply lines is a great way to stack the odds in our favour against better equipped and more numerous opponents.

As part of the modernisation of the economy, many are calling for a focused expansion of electricity across our nation, so that no town will be left in the darkness."
UKR_subsidize_azovstal: "Subsidize Azovstal"
UKR_subsidize_azovstal_desc: "While it may sound redundantly obvious, it will be impossible to build an industrial region without the construction services to do so, as we are already finding companies struggling to meet the specifications of modern factories. Funding will be allocated for the expansion and modernisation of construction companies and their equipment. This effort should hopefully allow us to speed up the growth of our industrial capabilities."
UKR_kharkiv_weapons_factories: "Kharkiv Weapons Factories"
UKR_kharkiv_weapons_factories_desc: "Until now domestic weapons manufacturing in our nation has been practically non existent apart from artisanal hunting rifles.

UKR_urbanization_programs: "Urbanization Programs"
UKR_urbanization_programs_desc: "Many of our cities are old, and their infrastructure reflects this.

UKR_railway_improvements: "Railway Improvements"
UKR_railway_improvements_desc: "As part of our policy on state modernisation, we must expand the rail network in our predominantly agrarian nation.

UKR_odessa_state_university_desc: "Much of our rural population was never able to receive any form of education, and this has gone a long way to entrenching the economic divides and advancement problems in our nation. In a bid to remove the barriers many rural individuals experience due to their lack of education, we will intensify efforts to eliminate rural illiteracy across our nation. While it may prove costly, it is hoped that it will pay off in the long run."
UKR_new_industrial_areas: "New Industrial Areas"
UKR_new_industrial_areas_desc: "The most straightforward way to combat unemployment is to kickstart large public works projects the unemployed can participate in.

UKR_mining_grants: "Mining Grants"
UKR_mining_grants_desc: "Our nation's natural wealth remains mostly unsurveyed and unexploited. A state mining company should be established to finally survey what lies beneath our nation and put our natural resources fully to work."
UKR_economic_recovery: "Towards Economic Recovery"
UKR_economic_recovery_desc: "Social problems always provoke political instability. Lots of peasants join Socialist, nationalist or Russian separatist movements because of awful living conditions. If we want to save Ukraine from collapse, we should start a recovery programme and help the poorest grain-growers in Central Ukraine, providing our population with the cheap electricity they require. For this, we need cash."

UKR_privatization_spree: "Privatization Spree"
