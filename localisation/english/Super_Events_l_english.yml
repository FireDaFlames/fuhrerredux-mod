The declaration of war was issued to the German Empire and the Reichspakt. Across the world, armies mobilize for what they again hope to be the "War to End All Wars". Land, sea, and air warfare have broken out amongst the already tired land of Europe. Each side hopes to bring an end to the war quickly, as to not have a repeat of the traumatizing First Weltkrieg."
