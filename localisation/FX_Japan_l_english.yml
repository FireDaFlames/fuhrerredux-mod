#### Bookmark Description ####

JAP_FUHRERREDUX_DESC:0 "Japan is rising. In less than a century it has pulled itself from an isolated, feudal society to Asia's most industrialised and modern state. Emperor Hirohito rules over an young empire that simultaneously holds dominion over Korean and Taiwan, yet upholds a democracy based on American ideals. Lacking natural resources, Japan must advance even furr if it's to thrive in this uncertain world. Tennōheika Banzai!"

#####Events#####

jap.0.t:0 " Rising Sun"
jap.0.d:0 "While or nations were immolated in  Great War,  early 20th century has been a blessing to Japan. Gaining dominion over many of Germany's former pacific territories, Japan has continously stepped into  spotlight on  world stage. \n\nHowever,  nation's dabbling in Democracy is still new, and many wish to corrupt it to suit ir wishes. Many farmers struggle with  rapid pace of modernisation, and income inequality has exploded.  Zaibatsu, Japan's gargantuan conglomerates, have continued to stifle entrepreunership and innovation. It has been a golden age for Japan, but unless swift action is taken, stagnation may curse us. May  Emperor watch over us all."
jap.0.a:0 "Tennōheika Banzai!"

jap.1.d.0:0 "Ever since  First Sino-Japanese war, Korea has been firmly under our influence and in 1910, annexed into our Empire under direct rule.  situation has been met with variable responses, with recent events,  assimilation of Koreans have now been put onto our agenda. We now must decide on  speed of assimilation, or furr rebellion will be more often and in much larger scale, perhaps, even a full scale independance war."

jap.2.d.0:0 "As  Fifth Fengtien-Zhili war starts to rage in Norrn China, our interests in China forces our hand in support for one of  two clique, Zhili or Fengtien. One of which shall become victorious in  war and we must help one of m in ir ultimate conquest to protect our interests. Now do we support  Zhili clique, whose military has proved itself time and time again, but lacks  industrial power of her neighbours, or  Fengtien governacy, whose area are wealthy in metal and owns  majority of  Manchurian railway?"

jap.3.d.0:0 "After  London Stock Market Crash, we now have a major trade deficiency as no one would buy our products. To combat  trade deficiency, our politicians have decided to cut  budget for many departments, including both branches of  military.  generals of both branches have been notified and promised an expanded budget whenever  economy has been restored."

jap.9.d:0 " most unsettling five days in  British Empire since  start of  Great War has came, as  Empire's stock markets has been varying radically due to  fear of inability to get resources and goods from all corners of  Empire. Due to this, many British investors have withdrawn ir Japanese assets and caused a panic in our own stock markets as well. Not to mention  bankrupcy of quite a few Japanese trading partners, thus crippling our economy. Who knows what will happen due to this?"

jap.11.d:0 "A military coup d'état by  Righteous Army has been set off on  6th of September 1936, due to  result of military factionalism, constant rivalry against  government, and  recent London Stock Market Crash. This coup is is mostly comprised of young radical Imperial Japanese Army officers and ir goal is to eliminate  ideological rivals,  social conservatives. Many in  opposition party say that any harsh military action against  small army would lead to open rebellion of  Army and may result in a civil war! We must act carefully to not hurt eir side..."

jap.12.d:0 "With regiments of  Imperial Guard directed towards putting down  rebellion,  Righteous Army has been destroyed!  last of  commanders of  Righteous Army have been executed.  Righteous Army only managed to assassinate off few political members, as well as occupying  government center of Tokyo for a short while. Many citizens thanked  army, which came in and dealt with se traitors with no mercy. This rar unsettling rebllion may have proved to  two branches that we will crush any rebellions, but much more needs to be done before more of this happens."

jap.13.d:0 "Peace negotiations have been named, namely  unification of  military factionalism has been ended but for a cost of some political ministers of  ruling government. At  end, no Japanese life was lost at  end of  day and minimum damage has been made overall."

jap.14.d:0 "Just now, our naval exercise just off Manila,  capital of  Phillipines have succeed in it's true purpose - a surprise attack on both Filipino and American military bases and we triumphed!  president of  Phillipines is mad and   American President is shocked at our daring raid. We will win this war against  Imperialistic Foreigners!"

jap.15.d:0 "Yesterday, Japanese planes have attacked Filipino military bases and  American embassy! re has been many casualties of both nationalities and both us and  Phillipines are mad. Both  American and Filipino public are mad and request for war soared!  Phillipines are already at war with  Japanese now, leaving only us,  United States of America not at war. Our response shall be swift and deadly, and wipe this dishonorable empire off  face of  world!"

jap.16.d:0 "With  establishment of  Imperial Ruling Assistant Association, y have started  discuss  zaibatsu problem. se Zaibatsus are major conglomerates and each own an important part of our economy and industry. But as ir influence expands, y start to affect our government's policy, perhaps a little too much. Now we must decide on wher to start dissolving se Zaibatsus, or to prevent m from entering  political sphere entirely. Eir will help us complete our goal, but we must decide now, or never."

jap.17.d:0 "A few days ago,  American Gunboat USS Panay fired at Japanese ships who were participating in  casual naval gunnery exercise.  captain of USS Panay said y thought that  ships were firing in anger and not exercising. While no casualties were caused,  incident proved that not just  American and Japanese government are distrustful of each or, even  militaries of both countries perform  same. Now we wait until  diet and parliament agree on a complaint to  American government."

jap.18.d:0 "With anti-Japanese sentiment rising in China, citizens of Shanghai attacked many Japanese businessmen, destroyed and vandalised Japanese-owned property, including  burning of  Sanyou factory. An upsurge of anti-Imperialist sentiment was caused and protests to boycott Japanese goods and remove  concessions to Japan also broke out. While  Chinese Nationalist government claim that this was staged by Japanese agents, regardless of this, what we will do is not yet decided on. Now what do we do?"

jap.19.d:0 " Japanese diplomat has just sent us a number of demands, including  ability to position Japanese troops in our territories to stop se anti-Japanese sentiment and provide assistance to investigate  recent Shanghai incident. This demand will basically give up our national sovereignty and independence! But our [From.GetLeader] has not yet made any decision on  response. Perhaps he will give in to se demands or this will not. We can only wait..."

jap.20.d:0 "As our supporters,  Japanese have earned some concessions in  Fifth Fengtien-Zhili war. But now ir government has become much more imperialistic and started to expand. In ir path of expansion, we lie. Now as  Japanese have sent us ir ultimatum, do we refuse and wage a war we can ill fight against with Japan's technological might or do we submit to  imperialistic empire?  fate of Fengtien lies here and we do not know will we survive such a conflict."

jap.201.d:0 "Despite  fact our nation's great might clearly exceeds ir own, Fengtian has ignored our ultimatum."

jap.202.d:0 "Realizing Japan's great might and diplomatic conviction, Fengtian has accepted our ultimatum."

#Zhili ultimatum
jap.21.d:0 "Following multiple incidents in Qingdao, Dailian and  Manchurian peninsular,  Japanese has had enough and now sent us an ultimatum. To submit or to go to war with m. While we cannot afford to fight a war with ir technological might, we cannot afford to submit eir, as  entire population is doubtful of  future of Zhili under Japanese rule. All we know is that  fate and future of Zhili lies here, and we depend on it."

jap.211.d:0 "Despite  fact our nation's great might clearly exceeds ir own,  Zhili Clique has ignored our ultimatum."

jap.212.d:0 "Realizing Japan's great might and diplomatic conviction,  Zhili Clique has accepted our ultimatum."

#France peace proposal
jap.22.d:0 "After  Japanese invasion of our only Asian possessions, we no longer have any holdings in Asia, and we refore cannot fuel a war.  Japanese, through  Swiss diplomat has sent us asking for an armistice, or even peace. If we do, we will be giving up our Pacific possessions. We must consider this carefully."
#Russo-Japanese coalition
jap.23.d:0 " Japanese, who have supported us many times in  Russian Civil War, have sent a proposal for an alliance against  reds, who currently own  vast Russian lands. If we do accept, we will gain a powerful ally who undoubtedly will support us in every possible moment and will facilitate us in conquering  vast Soviet menace."

jap.24.d:0 " Japanese has allied with  British, and y now cooperate with m militarily. This means anor knife will be pointing at us, but this time in  Pacific. While it is unknown on how will  two countries will fight against us, it is sure that  two nations will band toger against us."

jap.25.d:0 "Improved relations with  United States has emboldened  Japanese to once again increase  size of ir Navy which is making our most isolated colonies even more vulnerable. We must counter this hostile move from  Japanese by any means we have."

jap.26.d:0 ""

jap.27.d:0 "Diplomats from  great and powerful nation of Japan have sent us an offer to form an anti-French alliance with m.  annexation of Siamese controlled Laos by  French following Franco-Siamese War of 1893 is still a contentious issue between our two nations and many within our country wish to reverse this. While  Japanese clearly intend to pressure French interests in South East Asia some ministers are weary of becoming too dependent on  Japanese."

jap.28.d:0 "Realizing our shared interests in French Indochina,  Siamese have agreed to our offer of an alliance."

jap.29.d:0 "Despite our shared interests in French Indochina,  Siamese have refused our offer of an alliance."

jap.30.d:0 "It's clear that we and Japan hold a shared interest in weakening Soviet influence in  Far East. Military personal from Japan have come to us with a plan to test Soviet defenses in  strategic region of Yakutsk. Our military with supplies from Japan will raid this region in a small scale buy highly coordinated attack. While  USSR outnumbers us greatly Tokyo believes that focused and decisive operations can quickly defeat Soviet divisions before y can be reinforced by reserves from Europe, an evolution of  strategy used by Japan to defeat Russia in 1905. While  Japanese envoy is highly confident in this plan, local Russian officers are understandably weary of provoking  USSR but we should also be weary of upsetting our Japanese ally."

jap.31.d:0 "With  persuading of our military envoy,  Russian have agreed to out plan to raid  Soviet strategic position in Yakutsk."

jap.32.d:0 "Despite  efforts of our military envoy to Chita,  Russians have rejected our plan to attack  Soviet defenses in Yakutsk. While many back in Tokyo wish to drop  issue for now  Japanese military have little patience for  Russians and are preparing plans to install a more \"amenable\" government in Chita."

jap.33.d:0 "Reports from our Siberian garrisons have relayed that White forces have crossed our border into our Far Eastern territory of Yakutsk.  scale of this raid isn't fully known as of yet but in any case we must quickly reinforce this position and push  whites back!"

jap.34.d:0 " \"Yakutsk Incident\" as some have begun to call it has come to a quick end.  sudden break out of violence between se two states has shocked  international community, some of whom suspect Japan in sparking  incident. All that really matters though is our decisive victory."

jap.35.d:0 " \"Yakutsk Incident\" as some have begun to call it has come to a quick end.  sudden break out of violence between se two states has shocked  international community, some of whom suspect Japan in sparking  incident. Our surprise defeat has shocked many of our ministers and officers who are now demanding significant reforms to better prepare our army against future battles."

jap.36.d:0 "Realizing our shared ambitions against  Soviet Union, Russia has agreed to form an alliance with us."

jap.37.d:0 "Despite our historic and continued support for ir little regime, Russia has refused to form an alliance with us."

jap.38.d:0 "Our attempts to find a peaceful solution to  growing political power of  Japanese Army has failed. When y threatened Japan's democracy we offered m an inch which y saw as an opportunity to take a mile. Slowly but surely Japan's civil government fell to  interests of  military. Under growing internal pressure even  Emperor himself has given into  demands of  military. What ever kind of democracy may have existed in Japan is now just a foot note in history."


jap.48.d:0 "Despite our efforts to improve relations with Britain and her people,  British Navy has refused to hand over  designs of  HMS Trafalgar. This modern ship is quite powerful and if we are to retain our place as e dominate power in  Pacific we must create a ship that can match it's strength."

jappol.11.d:0 "To help secure  very survival of Japan's democratic government we must reform how  military operates. Currently many of our top generals operate autonomously far from  supervision of Tokyo and as such y have very little interest in parliamentary politics. While this state of affairs has allowed for our military and nation to achieve many stunning victories against our enemies it has also turned Japan into a nation that effectively has two conflicting governments. If we are to secure  stability of our nation we must reign in Japan's most ambitious commanders and install loyalists in ir place."

jappol.16.d:0 " Police have recently just took in a soldier of  Imperial Japanese Navy who is suspected to be participating in a conspiracy against  democratic government. He has not leaked any information, but what this means is that  Navy is not discouraged despite  September 6 incident, where  Righteous Army's uprising was stopped. Now that we know of such conspiracy, we must start thinking of a solution to this, in order to safeguard democracy."

jappol.17.d:0 "As  Diet notified  Emperor about  conspiracy,  Emperor has told  Diet that he intends to speak to both branches of  Military to, quote, 'Speak about  recent events'.  Diet is split on this measure, fearing that  speech may lead to criticism of  Emperor by  general public. Now if  Prime Minister agree to  speech, it may lead to eir  Military giving up ir plans for coups or  Emperor will be criticised. What do we do?"

jappol.18.d:0 "Isoroku Yamamoto, one of  Admirals notified by  Imperial Diet, handed over  results of his investigation on  potential coup. He pulled his strings within  Imperial Japanese Navy and discovered plenty of officers and marines who were planning to coup later this year. He compiled a list of  officers and marines and gave it to  Imperial Diet. Now what will we do with this list of officers?"

jappol.19.d:0 "Yesterday, a group of naval officers and marines took hold of  Parliament and took hostage of  legislators. y demanded that  current Prime Minister resign and let a militarist become  new Prime Minister.  Imperial Japanese Army refused to intervene and  civilian government can only give into se demands, putting  Imperial Japanese Navy in command of  Empire. What lies in front of  path of  empire is unknown, yet conflict is sure to come soon quickly."

jappol.20.d:0 "With Yamamoto's report on  naval officers and marines,  Prime Minister has ordered  mass arrests of se traitors. This has stopped  potential coup at  cost of  personnel of  Navy. We must start recovery from this purge and reinforce  superiority of  democratic government over  two branches."

japhep.1.d:0 "As  Imperial Conference of 1937 drew to a close,  British called for a conference with us so negotiations and discussions for  continuation of  Anglo-Japanese Alliance and or issues with Japan will continue. Delagations from Britain has reached Osaka and met for  first time today. Both delegations and governments are hopeful of this conference and wishes that both side will get what y want from  conference."

japhep.2.d:0 "With uncertainty of  ability to provide resources and economic stability after  London Stock Market Crash, many Japanese companies have resorted to trading with or countries and companies, such as American products and German iron.  British Empire suffered a rar great hit to ir trade and is not satisfied by this.  British Foreign Minister Anthony Eden has refore decided to discuss with  Japanese delegate about such trade, namely imports and exports of  Japanese Empire."

japhep.3.d:0 "As  British start to recover from  Stock Market Crash, many countries have abandoned  Gold Standard.  British delegates have told  Japanese delegates that  British government hopes to abandon  Standard or at least devaluate  Pound.  Japanese economic minister also supports such action. If we do this, we may be able to recover from  Stock Market Crash quicker."

japhep.4.d:0 " British delegates now said that  two Empires must band toger for protection against unnamed threats that are on  rise.  British delegate is certain that if Japan announces to modify  Anglo-Japanese alliance to join in and support  British Empire in any upcoming conflict,  unspecified threat will doubt any potential attack on both empires.  problem is that, do we, or do we not, fulfil such action?"

japhep.5.d:0 "With  1937 temporal renewal of  Anglo-Japanese Alliance soon coming to an end, we have called for a summit with  Japanese. While that is one thing off  agenda, we are not sure how will  Japanese respond to this summit, seeing our numerous acts of aggression in  interwar years. What we are doing now is nothing more than a gamble, and we can only hope for  best."

japhep.6.d:0 "With  London Stock Market Crash, many has lost much of ir confidence in our economic stability and trade, many Japanese investors included. With an agreement, we can make m inclined to trade with us again with terms for guranteeing ir trade and m being not affected with our tariffs. Hopefully se terms will be able to make m trade more with us again."

japhep.7.d:0 " Gold standard is our former economic standard, while we have our plans on  standard, we do not want any of our trade partners being unable to trade with us continuously, or we will just undo  trade agreement signed previously. We shall encourage m to abandon  Gold Standard."

japhep.8.d:0 "Despite some disagreement on some terms, our delegates have reported that it may be suitable for us to ask for Anglo-Japanese Alliance. Perhaps  Japanese will finally want to continue our alliance, both for protection, or for deterrance."

japhep.9.d:0 "With much greatness, we and Great Britain has put aside our disagreements and finished  discussion of  Hirota-Eden Pact. This pact shall show  greatness of diplomacy and ensure  success of both  Empire of Japan and  Empire of Great Britain."

japhep.10.d:0 "Our delegates in Kyoto has reported back to Downing Street that  Japanese has accepted  extension of  Anglo-Japanese Alliance. This means that most of our hopes for  summit is fulfilled, despite most political councillors' conservative hopes. This will be  most influential conference in history. We shall rejoice at such event!"

japhep.100.d:0 "Our government, before  new elections take place, hopes to solve  problem of  not-yet-terminated Anglo-Japanese Alliance. Right now  cabinet is undergoing heavy debates at Downing Street to renew  alliance temporarily for three years. Many throughout  government are concerned if this alliance will stay for long, especially when our actions have alienated quite a lot of our former allies."

japhep.101.d:0 "Britain has just told our minister for foreign affairs that y wish to renew  Anglo-Japanese Alliance for three more years and it is up to us to decide wher or not  alliance will continue.  Navy and Army are supportive of  renewal, but  diet is divided for such action, as many acts by  British have alienated ir former allies and made many enemies."

japhep.102.d:0 " Japanese Diet has sent a letter to  Foreign Office, saying that y have decided to renew  Alliance, following our proposal of a 3 year temporal renewal, until a complete discussion later. However,  letter has stated that numerous actions by  British Empire has conflicted with Japan and her interests. It will take a lot of actions by  British Empire to undo such acts of aggression against m."

japhep.103.d:0 " Japanese Diet has sent a letter to  Foreign Office, saying that y have decided to terminate  Alliance, against our proposal for a 3 year temporal renewal.  letter stated that too many acts of aggression was done by  British Empire against  Japanese empire and has influenced m to terminate  alliance due to not hoping to associate mselves with constant aggressors."

japhep.104.d:0 " British diplomat to us has just left us a letter, saying that it is in ir nation's interests to terminate  Alliance, due to  overwhelming uncertainty posed by our actions, drifting away from  British interests, aligning ourselves with or nations.  Diet has not made any official comment on  letter currently."

japhep.105.d:0 "As we enter [GetYear], one of  problems arise as  temporaily renewed Anglo-Japanese alliance comes to an end. With  3 years ending without much conflict between  both nations, many think that this means  two nation's interests are once again, closer to each or. Quite a number of people support aligning Japan with us fully through inviting m to  Imperial Protection Alliance, but this must be done with thorough discussion."

japhep.106.d:0 " British diplomat entered  halls of  Foreign Ministry today, concerned, speaking of holding a conference between  two countries. It is sure that this conference will concern  fate of  Anglo-Japanese Alliance as  temporal renewal ends.  Diet is more optimistic towards holding  conference to discuss  fate of  Alliance. Perhaps it will go miraculously and we will be happy after all, or it may go poorly and both parties will go with a sour face."

japhep.107.d:0 "Japan has notified our diplomat over re that y will not discuss  Alliance, still citing  noticible times where  British have went against  interests of Japan. refore, y will also terminate  alliance.  Foreign Minister has already announced that Britain will not try to attempt to keep Japan as a part of  Alliance."

japhep.108.d:0 "Japan has notified our diplomat at Japan stating that y will terminate  Alliance immediately, citing  aggression of  British actions.  Foreign Minister has stated that  British Empire will not try to continue  alliance, stating 'A unpleasant alliance is against both nation's interests'. However, a number of our political advisors has advised against just letting go."

japhep.109.d:0 "Britain has notified our diplomat to terminate  Alliance immediately, citing numerous unpleasant times of cooperation between  two nations, and how it is 'better for no relation than a mutually despiscing one'. Numerous political commentators are very suprised by Britain's actions, but have remained neutral on  issue."

japsanfran.1.d:0 "Our intelligence sharing with  Americans was just in time. With us inviting m to a summit, y accepted and proposed to hold it in San Francisco. We shall decide a solution to  HMS Trafalgar and numerous or minor items. Now we shall participate immediately, without any doubts, as time is not on our side."

japsanfran.2.d:0 " Japanese's invitation of us to a summit about  naval problems and  pressing issue to HMS Trafalgar led to a summit in San Francisco. Now we shall participate to solve se issues. Now we must hold this summit as soon as possible, or our ships will be defeated easily."

japsanfran.3.d:0 "After 18 years of  Washington Naval Treaty which limited both ours and  United States of America's shipbuilding,  British has launched  Super Heavy Battleship HMS Trafalgar which endangers both  American and  Japanese navy. We,  Japanese shall call for a summit to declare  end of  treaty and restart  fleet construction programs of both countries to ensure  security of our seas. If  Americans does not align with our cause, we must stop following m."

japsanfran.4.d:0 " Japanese delegates, on  first day of  Summit, has said that 'With  HMS Trafalgar, we must stop limiting our navies immediately' and called for  immediate termination of  Washington Naval Treaty, and instead, band toger for naval technology sharing to catch up for  missing interwar naval development."

japsanfran.5.d:0 "Due to our reliance on importing resources, we have mentioned that we should stop importing British goods and import more American goods. But if we embargo Britain and America embargoes us, our entire economy may stop functioning properly. To prevent this, we must sign an agreement with  United States. If this is signed, we can ensure this does not happen and  USA will always support us economically and resource-wise."

japsanfran.6.d:0 "With  reliance of Japan on our exports, if we embargo m, ir economy will be heavily damaged. Because of this, y have requested a trade treaty with m. With this trade treaty, we can lower our reliance of British goods. While y don't have  amount of resources Britain has,  less ties we have we  British,  less problems we will have when we go to war with m."

japsanfran.7.d:0 "With Texas being basically ran by Standard Oil, we have little way to stop such monopoly. With  Japanese companies such as Mitsubishi and Kawasaki, se companies can contest  trust in Texas. We shall notify  Japanese delegates on this."

japsanfran.8.d:0 " Americans have notified us on Standard Oil, one of  largest Oil Companies on Earth, and ir monopoly over  Texan Oil industry. In order to help counter  trust that John D. Rockafeller has,  American negotiator has asked us to promote investments by  Zaibatsus, such as Nippon Oil, into  American market. This deal would help Japan secure a stable source of US oil for our growing needs while  Americans would gain a much needed source of foreign capital.”

japsanfran.9.d:0 "With  evaluation done by  Department of Defense on Pacific bases, y have concluded that we need more allies in  Pacific to supply an army against any possible interests. Now with  San Francisco Summit, it is best for us to ask, since  Pacific Bulwark will be able to fight off any aggression."

japsanfran.10.d:0 "Due to  lack of an American fortress in East Asia besides  Phillipines, which cannot fully support a full fleet of America or Guam, which is too small to supply a sized American army. If  Americans are allowed basing rights, in return we will also gain basing rights on American bases. While this might not be as well as an military alliance, this is just as good a deal."

japsanfran.11.d:0 " Department of Defence has recommended  president to quickly propose an coalition with  Japanese. While  edges still need to be worked out, we must ensure that Japan will be with us, or if y aren't, we shall defeat m sooner or later."

japsanfran.12.d:0 " American President, in response to  great acceptance to ir proposals, have proposed one last add-on.  American-Japanese Alliance.  forged alliance will protect both Japanese and American interest in  Pacific, combating  British imperialism.  details will be discussed only if  Japanese agreed to  Alliance first."

japsanfran.13.d:0 " Japanese have accepted  Great Pacific Treaty! With this known, many throughout  government rejoice! With this, it is sure that  Japanese will become a definite ally of us. This means that our grand pacific alliance will be able to protect  interests of our own, no matter what."

japsanfran.14.d:0 "As negotiation talks break down,  Japanese has declared that y will not be limited by this treaty, in one way or anor. Now this will mean that war will come, no body is sure, but what is sure is that  Washington Naval Treaty will no longer be valid."

japele.1.d:0 " Election of 1936 is here. As usual, only Rikken Minseitō and Rikken Seiyūkai are competeting to be elected. This year Minseitō promised for more rights for workers while Seiyūkai hopes to modernise  railway systems.  election seems to be neck and neck and no one seems to be able to win completely. Who will win this year?"

japele.2.d:0 "As  new Parliament starts to draft a new budget for  upcoming two years,  both branches of  Military are asking for  priority. We only have enough money for one of  two branches, so who shall we provide it to?  staggering army needs extra funding for expansion to ensure  security of our overseas possessions and research? Or  aging navy of which many ships have aged and needs modernisation and improvements completed soon?"

japele.3.d:0 " Elections of 1938 is here. With  many crisis we have gone against, we shall choose a new and strong government. Minseitō has been calling for more rights for workers, while Seiyūkai wishes to in"

japtraf.5.d:0 "Our spies have reported to our Naval Attache in Britain that a new battleship is on trial, named HMS Trafalgar. Not just any normal battleship. She is a super heavy battleship, armed with brand new, state-of--art 18 inch guns, unopposed armor and an unrivaled amount of Anti-Air armament. She is so powerful, that one of her can rival 3 or 4 battleships, freeing up capital ships for  British home waters and threaten our naval supremacy in  Asian seas. We shall notify our American allies and decide our action on it."

jap.44.d:0 "As  sea trials of HMS Trafalgar continue, our Admirals panic at such a balance disrupting design so out of  blue. With some of  admirals pulling mselves toger, y have written a request for a discussion within  diet. While this directly bypasses  parliament,  diet seems to not care in such time of importance. Now, with  diet finally assembled to discuss our response to such  act, we can truly decide our actions. Some in  admiralty suggest requesting  British foreign ministry for  design, while some suggest stealing it. What shall we do now?"

jap.45.d:0 "Our Foreign Office has just received a letter from  Japanese Diet, requesting that us give  Japanese navy a duplicate for  design for our state-of--art flagship, HMS Trafalgar.  Admiralty is currently hosting a fierce debate for  confidentiality of our trials, while both houses of  government are hosting debates just as fierce for wher or not we should hand over  designs. If we do, we can be sure that Japan will be building a ship of roughly  same displacement and analyise  weaknesses of our design, but if we don't, we will be damaging our relationship heavily. Do we risk it or not?"

jap.46.d:0 "A messenger from  Admiralty has just reached  Foreign Office, swearing as he bust into  halls of  office, informing  Foreign Secretary about  arrest of a \"sneaky bugger lurking inside  Admiralty, near  archives\".  lurker is believed by both  Scotland Yard and  Admiralty as an spy for  Japanese government, our supposed ally. Now we do not have a suitable respond just yet, but we shall accuse  Japanese for shady actions for some mere designs!"

jap.47.d:0 "Our foreign ministry has just received a document from  British diplomat, saying that it is an 'early Christmas Present' and ' Admiralty will love it'. After analyzing, it seems that  document is  design for HMS Trafalgar.  Admiralty is very glad for  design and has started assembling a Committee for  analysis for  design. We shall send  British our utmost gratitude."

jap.49.d:0 "Bakayaro! Our spy who was sent to steal  designs of Trafalgar was caught, and  British are accusing us of provoking aggression and  British populace is up in arms!  most outrageous nationalistic claims of us say that we are harboring imperialistic hopes and warmonging beliefs, while  most reasonable are still biased towards  British.  Diet has already offered an official apology for  indecent act of  thief, while denying any possible connections to him. This has gone very badly despite  high expectations of  operation planners."

jap.51.d:0 "We just recently joined  ranks of  Imperial Protection Alliance, but many think we do not belong and are of inequal footing to m. For  sake of a lasting relationship, we must start securing our place in  alliance. But many in  government are debating on how should we secure our place. Our most obvious ways is to persue more economic cooperation inside  Imperial Protection Alliance, or to persue more military cooperation by trading military technology."

jap.52.d:0 " Japanese diplomat has just met with  Foreign Secretary and shown Japan's hopes for persuing furr economic cooperation, by more mutual economic trade and investments. He claims this is due to  dissentient by or allies. y have already started drafting a proposal for economic investment, ranging from new steam locomotives and new civilian planes to brand new shipping route services.  Japanese are very keen for securing ir place in  Alliance as an integral part, inseperable."

jap.53.d:0 " Japanese diplomat has just met with  Foreign Secretary to discuss Japan's hopes for persuing furr military cooperation. He claims that this is due to dissentient by or allies.  two Foreign ministers have discussed how can  two cooperate furr. Some concepts include some war games in different terrain to furr train  troops in different terrain and exchanging advisors for doctrine development.  Japanese are very keen for securing ir place in  Alliance as an integral part, inseperable."

Adding m to  faction would help our and German's influence over Asia and may get help in  near future, namely reclaiming our former colony of Indonesia."
