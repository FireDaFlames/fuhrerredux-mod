### Events
romania.0.t:0 "The Kingdom of Romania in 1936"
romania.0.d:0 "In 1883, the Romanian king Carol I made a secret deal with the Triple Alliance that entailed a defensive alliance with Austria-Hungary. Romania remained neutral for the first two years of the Great War. In 1916, Romania officially joined the Entente and declared war upon the Central Powers.\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian army in Galicia pushed far into Moldova, capturing the city of Galati. The combined Romanian-Entente made a valiant last stand in Bucharest. Romania was turned into nothing more than a rump state subservient to Germany.\n\nWhen the Central Powers capitulated to the Entente in 1919, Romania was freed from German bondage. Representatives from both Bukovina and Transylvania arrived in Bucharest to declare union with Romania. Ferdinand I's reign would be characterized by stabilization of the socio-economic position of Romania. With the appointment of Prince Michael as the heir to the throne, Prince Nicholas was appointed regent in behalf of his brother; however, the other members of the regency deposed Nicholas for planning a coup against the incoming king; and Nicholas went into a self-imposed exile into Transylvania.\n\nRomania's democratic and constitutional monarchy is slowly trending more towards a populist dictatorship; while the National Peasants Party still holds majority in the Government; other opposition parties such as the Iron Guard can take drastic actions in hopes to rising into power. The incoming elections will truly determine the fate of the Romanian Government; whether it will still hold its status quo; provide a more progressive government or become a populist dictatorship is still to be seen."
romania.0.a:0 "A new future for Romania!"
romania.1.t:0 "Appointing the New Regent"
romania.1.d:0 "The recent death of Constantin Sarateanu has left the position of regent vacant. His royal highness, Prince Michael has instructed the council to begin the appointment of a new regent. While the obvious choice maybe getting a person from the most popular party; there are also other options available."
romania.1.a:0 "Appoint from the ruling party"
romania.1.b:0 "Try courting the PNL"
romania.1.c:0 "Maybe a coalition with PSDR won't hurt"
romania.2.t:0 "Coronation of Michael I"
romania.2.d:0 "Today is the day, Prince Michael son of the former King Carol II has just became 16 years old allowing him to take the Romanian kingship. In a ceremony at the Patriarchal Cathedral in Bucharest, the young King was crowned with the Steel Crown and anointed by the Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church. While the king retains significant powers, Michael is a figurehead largely sidelined by the Prime Minister, and there is little reason for this to change anytime soon."
romania.2.a:0 "God Save King Michael!"
romania.3.t:0 "The London Stock Market Crashed!"
romania.3.d:0 "Yesterday, the London stock market crashed, plunging the world into a depression. Already it is being labelled the so-called 'Black Monday' crash. Our nation has strong economic ties to the United Kingdom and many British companies are now shutting down their Romanian factories, plunging hundreds of thousands into immediate unemployment. Our banks were greatly exposed to the impact of the Crisis, and its effects are already becoming evident across most of the country."
romania.3.a:0 "This could be bad."
romania.4.t:0 "Economic Recovery from Black Wednesday"
romania.4.d:0 "Due to the number of significant programs and reforms done by the government, the Romanian economy has fully recovered from last year's effects of the London Stock Market crash. Our economists have predicted that inflation will be soon under control again and interest rates will be back to normal. Importantly, the average Romanian citizen is now feeling the effects of the recovery; having a sustainable income to purchase stable prices of household goods."
romania.4.a:0 "Thank God it's over..."
romania.5.t:0 "Tensions in Translyvania"
romania.5.d:0 "There are reports of tensions between our security forces and the ethnic Hungarians living in the areas that once owned by Hungary; specifically in the Translyvanian region. With the economic crisis experiencing in Romania; many citizens in the region with Hungarian descent have demonstrated in various government installations; citing that the government didn't do much to help them in this economic crisis. While some of our intelligence overatives say that the [HUN.GetAdjective] is behind on all of this to destabilize the region; it also means that the [ROM.GetAdjective] Government failed to address the needs of its citizens during this difficult times."
romania.5.a:0 "This is bad..."
romania.6.t:0 "Railroad Explosion in Transylvania"
romania.6.d:0 "This morning in Transylvania, many have been awoken by the blast appearing to have come from the railroad installations in the outskirts of the city. While thankfully there are no casualties; the railroad have been under repairs for several hours; hindering the travels of our trains arriving and departing from the region. Many from our intelligence sources have concluded that this is an act by [HUN.GetAdjective]s who are sympathetic to the regime in [HUN.Capital.GetName]."
romania.6.a:0 "Arrest the conspiritors!"
romania.7.t:0 "A Possible Coalition?"
romania.7.d:0 "Since Virgil Madgearu is appointed the 3rd regent of the Kingdom, effectively becoming its new Head of Government or Prime Minister, there are proposals within his party and some prominent officials from PDaT; to consider trying to gain a coalition with the PDaT, a radical republican socialist party operating here in Romania. The possible coalition would in fact strengthen the support of the grip of power of the PSDR if elected; however, it can leave a bad taste in the mouth of some radical right groups opposing socialism."
romania.7.a:0 "The coalition is created"
romania.7.b:0 "Madgearu decides against it."
romania.8.t:0 "Meeting with the Georgist Faction?"
romania.8.d:0 "The Conservatives of the PNL has a support from the people that is foolish to ignore. In order to secure the support of Constantin Bratianu in the Parliament, there have been advice to meet with the Georgist faction of the PNL in order to gain their support; cementing the power of the current Prime Minister. While this can strengthen the support of the Bratianu faction of the PNL; this however, can alienate the supporters of the Maniu faction."
romania.8.a:0 "Schedule a meeting with the Conservatives."
romania.8.b:0 "This is too risky."
romania.9.t:0 "Meeting with the Progressives"
romania.9.d1:0 "The Progressive faction of the PNL is currently headed by Iuliu Maniu; having a significant support in the PNL itself and in the people. Since we decided to opt out of having a coalition with the Georgists of the PNL; we can easily create a coalition with the progressives; effectively strengthening our support in both the Parliament and the middle class."
romania.9.d2:0 "While we opted to have a coalition with the Georgist faction of the PNL; alienating the Progressives in the process, we can try courting them; promising a couple of reforms once we are elected. However, we must be ready for a tension within our own coalition; as the Conservatives and Progressives do not sit well with each other."
romania.9.a:0 "Try courting the Progressives."
romania.9.b:0 "The coalition with the Georgists is enough."
romania.9.c:0 "We'll be elected without them"
romania.10.t:0 "Madgearu Proposes Reforms"
romania.10.d:0 "The leader of the PDaT or the Democratic People's Party, Virgil Madgearu has visited the office of the Prime Minister today proposing a number of social and economic reforms. While some of the reforms were in fact already being prepared by the new regent; some of it were completely too radical to be given attention. While Madgearu assured the Prime Minister that the reforms are needed to modernize Romania and protect its people; it doesn't include the fact that some of the reforms will be completely anger the far-right if implemented."
romania.10.a:0 "The Regent Accepts the Reforms"
romania.10.b:0 "It's too radical to be called a reform"
romania.11.t:0 "PDaT Backs out from Coalition"
romania.11.d:0 "The Democratic People's Party and its leader have formally announced to the public that the proposed coalition for the upcoming elections witht the PSDR is now in shambles.\n\nIt isn't clear why the strong coalition has come to an end; but some of our insiders within the parties suggest that the rejection of the Prime Minister of the proposed reforms by Madgearu was the root cause."
romania.11.a:0 "Even if they are socialists they are nothing alike."
romania.12.t:0 "Tensions in the Coalition"
romania.12.d:0 "It is quite impressive that Prime Minister Constantin Bratianu have successfully created a coalition with the Progressive and Conservative factions of his own party; the PNL or the National Liberal Party. However, the coalition is now beginning to rift as the there are tensions between either side wanting to propose different legislation. We can side with either the Progressives or the Conservatives; however it will alienate the other one we did not support; on the other hand, we can safely force a compromise to secure the future of the coalition."
romania.12.a:0 "Side with the Georgists"
romania.12.b:0 "Side with the Progressives"
romania.12.c:0 "Force a compromise"
romania.13.t:0 "Georgists Leaves the Coalition"
romania.13.d:0 "The Conservative Faction of the PNL or the National Liberal Party have announced that they are leaving the coalition of Bratianu. It seems that the Georgists are dissapointed that they are being sidelined by the Prime Minister; opting to implement many of the reforms authored by the Progressive Faction."
romania.13.a:0 "And so it crumbles..."
romania.14.t:0 "Progressives Leaves the Coalition"
romania.14.d:0 "The Progressive Faction of the PNL or the National Liberal Party have announced that they are leaving the coalition of Bratianu. It seems that the Georgists are dissapointed that they are being sidelined by the Prime Minister; opting to implement many of the reforms authored by the Conservative Faction."
romania.14.a:0 "And so it crumbles..."
romania.15.t:0 "Peasant Unrest in Bucharest"
romania.15.d:0 "The economic recession have made the situation of Romania's peasant population worse and worse by the day; and this day they took off to the streets demanding that the government help them or they will die of hunger. While the government has the current financial capability to feed them once or occassionally, this can have negative impact on some of our projects; making their development slower than planned."
romania.15.a:0 "Food is a basic right, give it to them."
romania.15.b:0 "They should find work in order to feed themselves."
romania.16.t:0 "Nationalization of Foreign Corporations"
romania.16.d:0 "As French and Italian banks collapsed, so did the Foreign corporations owning large parts of Romanian oil industry. The exports-based economy of Romania crashed hard after the demand for oil and agricultural products hit the rock bottom in the Continental Entente, which has been Romania's main trading partner. Unemployment soared sky-high in a fortnight, and our largest bank is on the precipice of collapse.\n While most non-socialist countries simply have to endure the collapse, our government holds a significant control over the economical system. Should we desire so, we could obtain the assets of crashed foreign corporations quite cheaply and nationalize the refinery industry, saving thousands of Romanian jobs in the process. This might not be a popular move in Paris or Rome, however, but it would send a strong message about Romania's sovereignity and the dedication of the government to the well-being of all Romanians."
romania.16.a:0 "Nationalize the foreign industries"
romania.16.b:0 "Continue nationalization but pay with modest price."
romania.17.t:0 "The [GetYear] General Elections"
romania.17.d1:0 "According to the Constitution, elections are to be held every four years. The term of the members of the Parliament have expired and it's now time to elect a new batch of members of the Parliament. There are a number of parties running to get a majority within the legislature, there is the current National Peasants Party who currently controls of Parliament, the National Liberal Party that has a strong influence over the legislation, the PSDR who has support of the workers and unions, and finally the Iron Guard who has the strong opposition to the status quo. Which one will prevail?"

Which one will prevail?"
romania.17.a:0 "The status quo is unshaken."
romania.17.b:0 "The liberals secured popular vote."
romania.17.c:0 "A suprise victory from the PSDR"
romania.17.e:0 "The Iron Guard secures victory"
romania.17.f:0 "The Christian Party narrowly takes the majority"
romania.18.t:0 "North Railway Station Fire"
romania.18.d:0 "The central station in Bucharest has caught fire, resulting in the destruction of the entire upper floor. An investigation by the authorities has concluded that the tragedy has likely been caused by an electrical failure and thus that it was not the result of foul play. Already the press are demanding an official statement to print in tomorrow's newspapers."
romania.18.a:0 "Tell the press the truth"
romania.18.b:0 "Blame the Hungarian Nationalists"
romania.18.a:0 "Point finger to the Iron Guard."
romania.19.t:0 "Deploying troops in Transylvania"
romania.19.d:0 "The General Staff have proposed that we deploy troops to the region of Transylvania and nearby regions; in order to prevent what happened last months ago when Hungarian nationalists resisted our rule and bombed a railway station. Many within the cabinet are in favour of this motion, citing the security of the people must come first. However, garrisons of some of the major urban cities including Bucharest will be removed; as they are the chosen to be deployed to Transylvania."
romania.19.a:0 "Accept the motion"
romania.19.b:0 "Send some of the reserves"
romania.19.c:0 "Let the authorities in Transylvania handle it."
romania.20.t:0 "Prince Michael Assassinated"
romania.20.d1:0 "Earlier this morning, on his way to an official trip; Crown-Prince Michael of Romania was shot pointblank range from an unknown assailant. Prince Michael died immediately after being shot and the assailant escaped to the busy streets of Bucharest. The news was a shock to everybody as the prince is adored in the Kingdom. The government is now planning to invite back Prince Nicholas, as he is now the only candidate for the kingship of Romania."
romania.20.d2:0 "Earlier this morning, on his way to an official trip; Crown-Prince Michael of Romania was shot pointblank range by an unknown assailant. Prince Michael died immediately after being shot and the assailant was arrested by the security forces deployed in the region, soon  brought to an interrogation facility in the outskirts of Bucharest. The news was a shock to everybody as the prince is adored in the Kingdom. The government is now planning to invite back Prince Nicholas, as he is now the only candidate for the kingship of Romania."
romania.20.a:0 "The kingdom mourns..."
romania.21.t:0 "Coronation of Nicholas I"
romania.21.d:0 "Arriving from his self-exile in Transylvania, Prince Nicholas the brother of the late Prince Michael have arrived in Bucharest and have formally assumed the throne of the Kingdom of Romania.\n\nWhile still controversial on his attempts to depose his own brother in hopes to become king, the regency have fullfilled his dreams and have allowed him to assume the role of King."
romania.21.a:0 "God Save the King!"
romania.22.t:0 "Iron Guard Behind the Assassination"
romania.22.d:0 "Reports from the interrogation facility near the outskirts of the capital city of Bucharest, the assailant whom have killed Prince Michael have testified that the Iron Guard plotted the young prince's demise.\n\nThe report comes to no shock to the government however, as the Iron Guard has been reported to intimidate political opponents and eliminate journalists that spoke against them. The government have now the burden on whether to ban the party completely or just exile their prominent leaders."
romania.22.a:0 "Romania will be safe without the Iron Guard."
romania.22.b:0 "Arrest and exile Codreanu."
romania.23.t:0 "The Question of the Radicals"
