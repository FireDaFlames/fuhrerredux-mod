HOL_FUHRERREDUX_DESC:0 "Declaring itself a neutral country during the Great War; the Netherlands found itself its neutrality violated by both the Entente and Central Powers in the later years of the war. An offensive that pushed German troops in Belgium; as allowed a pressured Dutch Government into allowing them to flee through the Netherlands; effectively punishing them by the Entente Powers at the conclusion of the war.\n\nThe annexation of Zeuws-Vlaanderen and Limburg have sparked a rise in nationalism in the Netherlands; allowing Prince Bernhard to lead a coup and force the monarchy into exile. The charismatic prince desires to unify Belgium and the Netherlands; and try to do everything they can to achieve it."

### Leader Descriptions
POLITICS_PRINCE_BERNHARD_DESC:0 "Bernhard was born Bernhard Leopold Friedrich Eberhard Julius Kurt Karl Gottfried Peter, Count of Biesterfeld in Jena, Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, German Empire on 29 June 1911, the elder son of Prince Bernhard of Lippe and his wife, Baroness Armgard von Sierstorpff-Cramm. He was a grandson of Ernest, Count of Lippe-Biesterfeld, who was regent of the Principality of Lippe until 1904. He was also a nephew of the principality's last sovereign, Leopold IV, Prince of Lippe. Because his parents' marriage did not conform with the marriage laws of the House of Lippe, it was initially deemed morganatic, so Bernhard was granted only the title of Count of Biesterfeld at birth. He and his brother could succeed to the Lippian throne only if the entire reigning House became extinct. In 1916, his uncle Leopold IV as reigning Prince raised Bernhard and his mother to Prince and Princess of Lippe-Biesterfeld, thereby retroactively according his parents' marriage dynastic status. The suffix Biesterfedwas revived to mark the beginning of a new cadet line of the House of Lippe.\nBernhard suffered from poor health as a boy. Doctors predicted that he would not live very long. This prediction might have inspired Bernhard's reckless driving and the risks that he took. The prince wrecked several cars and planes in his lifetime.\nThe rise of nationalism in the Netherlands was lead by Bernhard Leopold Friedrich Eberhard, the man who married Princess Juliana, the daughter of Queen Wilhelmina. Inspired by Adam Dressler's rise in Germany, in 1934 Bernhard of the Netherlands launched a military coup d'etat. With German support he successfully couped the government and forced Wilhelmina's government into exile. Soon after, the Dutch State was established as a one party state lead by Dutch military and Bernhard of the Netherlands. Bernhard of the Netherlands expressed his desire to reclaim the provinces of Limburg and Zeeuws Vlaanderen from Belgium. But he did not stop there, he's gone further and he has made clear of  his idea to incorporate all of Belgium in to the Netherlands which severely hurt the relationship with the Continental Entente."
