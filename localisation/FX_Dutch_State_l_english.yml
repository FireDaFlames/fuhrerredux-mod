### Events
dutchstate.0.t:0 "The State of the United Provinces"
dutchstate.0.d:0 "Declaring itself a neutral country during the Great War; the Netherlands found itself its neutrality violated by both the Entente and Central Powers in the later years of the war. However, an offensive launched by the Entente have pushed German forces back to Belgium; effectively encircling them in Flanders. The German Government however, pressured the Dutch Government into allowing its troops to flee to Germany through the Netherlands. This have made the Entente powers seize the Dutch provinces of Limburg and Zeeuws-Vlaanderen and incorporate it into Belgium as a punishment.\n\nThe annexation of Limburg and Zeeuws-Vlaanderen have enraged the Dutch public, resulting in increased nationalism and help the far right parties grow its public support and its influence onto the Dutch Government. In 1934, Prince Bernhard; son-in-law of the Queen Wilhelmina; launched a military coup in overthrowing the current government. The coup was largely inspired by the rise of Adam Dressler in Germany, and also itself backed with German support. The Queen's government was forced into exile into Dutch Suriname.\n\nThe newly established Dutch State have aligned itself with Valkist Germany, creating an alliance named the Stahlpakt. The Prince desires not only the reclamation of the former Dutch provinces from Belgium; but the unification of Netherlands and Belgium itself severely hurting the relationship of the Dutch State and the Continental Entente."

dutchstate.3.a:0 "Maybe they have other plans perhaps?"
dutchstate.4.t:0 "Stahlpakt Embargoes Us!"
dutchstate.4.d:0 "Both the governments of [HOL.GetName] and [GER.GetName] have declared that they will officially put an embargo between our nations! It is a bold move from both of these authoritarian governments and will seriously hurt our trade profits."

dutchstate.5.t:0 "Trade Proposal from [From.GetName]"
dutchstate.5.d:0 "An envoy from the government of [From.GetName] has arrived in the Foreign Ministry today discussing a possible trade agreement between our nations. It seems that the many within the cabinet are supporting to accept the proposed trade offer by the [From.GetAdjective]; while some officials says that it will not benefit between us. What should be our response?"
dutchstate.5.a:0 "We'll do it"

dutchstate.11.t:0 "Resistance in Limburg and Zeeuws-Vlaanderen!"
dutchstate.11.d:0 "The former Dutch provinces of Limburg and Zeeuws-Vlaanderen are now erupting in an open resistance to the [Root.GetAdjective] control of the area. This provinces are awarded to us by the Entente as a punishment for the [HOL.GetAdjective] for allowing [GER.GetAdjective] troops to flee to Germany through the Netherlands. However; the area is still home to the majority of [HOL.GetAdjective] nationals; still bitter in the annexation of the provinces by Belgium. The [HOL.GetAdjective] Government have denied any involvement of the crisis; but instead, suggesting that the people living in those areas, are tired living under [BEL.GetAdjective] control.
dutchstate.11.a:0 "So it begins..."
dutchstate.12.t:0 "Suppressing the Resistance"
dutchstate.12.d:0 "The former Dutch provinces of Limburg and Zeeuws-Vlaanderen are suffering in an open resistance; many within the government are considering deploying the armed forces in order to quell the resistance and promote order. However, this can also lead to a more violent resistance if not implemented properly."

### Leader Descriptions
POLITICS_PRINCE_BERNHARD_DESC:0 "Bernhard was born Bernhard Leopold Friedrich Eberhard Julius Kurt Karl Gottfried Peter, Count of Biesterfeld in Jena, Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, German Empire on 29 June 1911, the elder son of Prince Bernhard of Lippe and his wife, Baroness Armgard von Sierstorpff-Cramm. He was a grandson of Ernest, Count of Lippe-Biesterfeld, who was regent of the Principality of Lippe until 1904. He was also a nephew of the principality's last sovereign, Leopold IV, Prince of Lippe. Because his parents' marriage did not conform with the marriage laws of the House of Lippe, it was initially deemed morganatic, so Bernhard was granted only the title of Count of Biesterfeld at birth. He and his brother could succeed to the Lippian throne only if the entire reigning House became extinct. In 1916, his uncle Leopold IV as reigning Prince raised Bernhard and his mother to Prince and Princess of Lippe-Biesterfeld, thereby retroactively according his parents' marriage dynastic status. The suffix Biesterfedwas revived to mark the beginning of a new cadet line of the House of Lippe.\nBernhard suffered from poor health as a boy. Doctors predicted that he would not live very long. This prediction might have inspired Bernhard's reckless driving and the risks that he took. The prince wrecked several cars and planes in his lifetime.\nThe rise of nationalism in the Netherlands was lead by Bernhard Leopold Friedrich Eberhard, the man who married Princess Juliana, the daughter of Queen Wilhelmina. Inspired by Adam Dressler's rise in Germany, in 1934 Bernhard of the Netherlands launched a military coup d'etat. With German support he successfully couped the government and forced Wilhelmina's government into exile. Soon after, the Dutch State was established as a one party state lead by Dutch military and Bernhard of the Netherlands. Bernhard of the Netherlands expressed his desire to reclaim the provinces of Limburg and Zeeuws Vlaanderen from Belgium. But he did not stop there, he's gone further and he has made clear of  his idea to incorporate all of Belgium in to the Netherlands which severely hurt the relationship with the Continental Entente."
